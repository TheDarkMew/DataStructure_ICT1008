"MrBrazen","scores for stickied comments are visible to mods only","Sun Jan 26 20:58:10 2020 UTC","Given his relation to CSGO and the plethora of rumors surrounding this crash on Twitter and in the media, it should be noted that the rumors alleging that Rick Fox was also aboard the helicopter are reported to be false by his daughter and multiple other sources. Please do not spread this rumor as it detracts from the focus of this tragedy. Unfortunately, however, TMZ does report that his daughter Gianna Bryant was with Kobe in the helicopter and died alongside her father in the crash."
"MidnightDeathNoodle","1871","Sun Jan 26 20:24:51 2020 UTC","Wow had no idea he passed today. Rip Kobe. Man was a legend."
"RJLPDash","847","Sun Jan 26 20:26:27 2020 UTC","Yeah, it wasn't the most pleasant way to go either, apparently his kids may have died with him but everything is still unconfirmed Either way it's sad Edit: Apparently it's confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was with him on the helicopter, Rest in Peace to them both, that shit is so sad"
"Crazyleprechaun87","233","Sun Jan 26 20:30:42 2020 UTC","From what ive seen on twitter its been confirmed one of his daughters was on the helicopter and Rick fox has also been confirmed to have not been involved in the crash. really wish people wouldnt just say shit on twitter / shitty online news articles for clicks."

"Crazyleprechaun87","51","Sun Jan 26 20:44:08 2020 UTC","yeah echo fox because his son was super into league so he got into the esports side to connect with him"

"eebro","198","Sun Jan 26 21:51:01 2020 UTC","The positive is that Kobe never felt the loss of his daughter and Gianna never felt the loss of her father. It's the people alive that suffer. So, if you are feeling sad, distraught, devastated, don't feel afraid to talk about it. Admitting the problem can help you overcome it. I hope his family has the strength to get through this horrible accident."
"RJLPDash","105","Sun Jan 26 21:53:23 2020 UTC","I just keep thinking about his Daughter, she had her whole life ahead of her and it's gone just like that Kobe was able to give his family everything, they had everything they could ever want or need and BAM it's all gone just like that, shit is fucking crazy"
"eebro","40","Sun Jan 26 22:00:10 2020 UTC","That's life. You never know when your time is. That's why it's important to live your life well, every second is important and you never really know how much you got."
"-Jerbear45-","15","Mon Jan 27 03:36:17 2020 UTC","He wasn't even that old himself. Only 41, had at least 40 in him likely. Didn't get to see himself make it into the Hall of Fame. RIP Kobe."
"Vordeo","7","Mon Jan 27 05:38:44 2020 UTC","I just keep thinking about his Daughter, she had her whole life ahead of her and it's gone just like that The thing is, Kobe had so much ahead of him too. Like, some athletes, once they retire you can pretty much figure they'll be out of the public eye outside of sporadic public appearances, etc. In the few years since he's retired, Kobe's won a fucking Oscar. Dude had an investment fund he was working on, and a plethora of other activities and shit. Dude was keeping active, dude had so much left to accomplish, and with his work ethic I wouldn't have bet against the man."
"Skystrike7","625","Sun Jan 26 21:25:25 2020 UTC","Yeet for distance, Kobe for accuracy."

"theroadtodrwaldo","72","Sun Jan 26 22:03:08 2020 UTC","Now would be the perfect time for the first HE skin. Would be an awesome way for CSGO to acknowledge how he transcended basketball. Either black snakeskin for the Black Mamba or a purple/yellow Lakers design."

"samtheanswer","6","Mon Jan 27 00:11:41 2020 UTC","Kobe is really special for counter strike community. When a player killed by a hand grenade from long distances or hard angles, you can see hundreds of people spamming KOBEEE on chat. Not Jordan, not LeBron or not some other legend player. It was always Kobe and it will always be. And now it's more meaningful than ever, whenever a KOBEEE moment happen we remember his memory. Rest in peace Legend."

His name made me want to be like him, his name kept the comedy going during a good comp session in cs, his name will forever be with us. A coworker told me about the news while we were working, and after 9 hours it still hasn't clicked in my head that Kobe really is gone. I never knew the man personally, but I know the whole world grieves, especially for his daughter. It's just, sad knowing that we could just die doing our normal routine (They were heading to practice at Mamba Academy I heard). Gianna had so much in front of her at 13 years old, and she had her dad to lead her through. Rest in Piece Kobe, the whole world will never forget you. You have connected everyone through your name."

We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376 Sources: Kobe Bryant was on his way to a travel basketball game with his daughter Gianna when the helicopter crashed.

"HvyMetalComrade","1902","Sun Jan 26 19:43:42 2020 UTC","Kobe Bryant died in a helicoper crash in Calabasas Sunday morning ... TMZ Sports has confirmed. Kobe was traveling with at least 3 other people in his private helicopter when it went down. A fire broke out. Emergency personnel responded, but nobody on board survived. 5 people are confirmed dead. We're told Vanessa Bryant was not among those on board. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Kobe has famously used a helicopter to travel for years -- dating back to when he played for the Lakers. He was known for commuting from Newport Beach, CA to the STAPLES Center in DTLA in his Sikorsky S-76 chopper. KB is survived by his wife Vanessa, and their four daughters -- Gianna, Natalia and Bianca and their newborn Capri."

TMZ did not say this, their article stuck to the facts as far as I can tell. Edit 2: apparently tmz now reporting 1 daughter was in fact on the helicopter.

"kevohreal","551","Mon Jan 27 03:23:30 2020 UTC","It's terribly sad. I was at that game with my brother (Dec 29 v. Mavericks) when Kobe and Gianna were courtside. The Lakers IG account posted a picture of him on the floor wearing a bright orange jacket, so we looked for him and sure enough there he was. It was a nice surprise now turned into a somber memory, considering that game was also my Christmas gift to my brother who's been a die-hard fan for over 20 years. Those tickets ended up being the last time we would get to see him (and his daughter) alive. RIP : ("

"not_so_plausible","213","Sun Jan 26 21:56:28 2020 UTC","This basically happened in my backyard. As a pilot myself, visibility was incredibly low and it looks like they flew into a mountain under IFR. Edit: listened to the ATC recording and after reading more about the flight, this pilot was trying to fly VFR under really low ceiling in a low mountainous region. The clip I listened to was a transition from Burbank class C airspace to Van Nuys class D (my home airport). Van Nuys cleared the pilot to follow the 101 freeway, which is just south of the field, towards Camarillo. Presumably, the pilot was too low to receive traffic alerts and instruction from the SoCal radar center and that was the last he was heard of. Convinced this pilot tried to squeeze between the mountain and the low cloud layer. The helicopter they were in is multi engine and has an incredibly low mechanical failure rate. I’m not going to blame the pilot without details but most aviation accidents are due to pilot error and the way this is developing is making me think that’s the case here. Edit 2: according to reports, even LAPD helicopters were grounded due to weather this morning and they usually rotate 4 airships at all times."

"twointimeofwar","2115","Sun Jan 26 22:41:03 2020 UTC","During the live press conference, the sheriff said that they believe there were 9 people on board, a pilot and 8 passengers. He also called out TMZ for being wildly inappropriate and said “imagine finding out a loved one has died through social media”, he has requested that people stop speculating who was on board and to keep their loved ones in mind. Edit: I watched the rest, this time the man that spoke before the sheriff came back (man with a grey streak in his hair, dark green shirt and dark skin): they don’t know anything for sure yet. They received the report 9:47 AM, arrived 8 minutes later and due to magnesium, the fire took one hour to extinguish. The coroner is on site with a team and they’re working hard to get answers. They don’t know what happened, they don’t know where the helicopter took off, they don’t know for sure where it was going (these three questions kept being asked). It will take some time to identify everyone and to notify the next of kin, he once again stressed for people to stop speculating and to keep loved ones on mind. The area that they are investigating is “about an acre”, that’s also where they expect most debris to be at and where bushes were on fire. Honestly, it was him constantly repeating that they don’t know what happened yet since the press kept asking the same questions. They also kept pestering him about “taking an hour to extinguish” - but again, that’s because of the magnesium. After that they called for a spokesperson that can speak Spanish and I turned it off. Good news article here that has a better summary of the conference and updates."

I remember being nervous that he would order a drink and I’d have to be in the uncomfortable position of carding him, knowing he was under 21. At the time we had some other out of control under aged celebs that created drama (Leo DeCaprio I’m talking to you) When Kobe got to the bar, he ordered an Evian.

"Zhaggygodx","544","Sun Jan 26 21:26:26 2020 UTC","I do this too and it usually gives me crazy anxiety and I feel sick to my stomach. Just goes to show myself that no matter how privileged and extravagant his life probably was, death in that manner in the last seconds/minutes doesn’t care about how much money you have or how much the world adores you — we all would die the same way with the same fear running through us as he did."
"SquareLevelPlumb","488","Sun Jan 26 23:03:25 2020 UTC","I was on a commercial flight years ago that lost power and cabin pressure at 30,000 feet. We plummeted 20,000 feet before they got power back up, and then spent another 15 minutes at 10,000 feet with the most insane turbulence I’ve ever felt trying to make it to another airport for an emergency landing. During that time when everything was dark and we were just falling, I was filled with intense fear and so many other emotions. Outside of the extreme fear and anxiety I was feeling, the only other thing going through my head was how can I say goodbye to my family. I was frantically trying to turn my phone on in hopes of writing a goodbye letter in my notepad and text messages in hopes that they would at least find it in the wreckage if we crashed. It’s been over ten years now since it happened and I still get extreme anxiety anytime I’m flying and we start to descend in altitude. The first few years flying after that I needed to take large amounts of Xanax to even get on a plane. Every time I read about a crash like this it brings back so much anxiety."

Seniors are already larger than life to freshman but can you imagine having Kobe as your idol, 360 dunking IN GAME, taking Brandy to the prom etc. When I was a senior he would always hook the team up with Adidas gear and come visit Coach Downer once in a while & give us a pep talk. He made me believe that anything is possible. This news makes me sick to my stomach but I promise if Kobe could speak he would say don't be sad because he achieved all his dreams and then some. He would probably want us to focus on our own aspirations and pray for the families of the other four who died. He was as fierce a competitor you could find, but off the court was a gentleman, a beautiful dichotomy. RIP I still cant believe it."

Sinking two free throws after a torn Achilles. The 60 points finale. So many memories. Off the court he seemed very philanthropical as well, with a growing influence in business.

Flight tracker data shows Kobe's chopper appeared to first encounter weather issues as it was above the L.A. Zoo. It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear. Play video content FLIGHT TOWER AUDIO We know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA. At around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet. However, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 185mph."

I was with my uncle at South Coast Plaza in Santa Ana, CA. My uncle and I were on the 2nd floor sitting at one of the tables at Antonello Espresso Bar. As we’re sitting there, we see Kobe walking towards us. He was with his two daughters. My uncle looks at me and says “Kobe speaks Italian; watch this!” In Italian, my uncle yells out to Kobe, “Kobe! Want a cup of espresso? Kobe smiles kind of laughs and politely responds in Italian “no thank you I’m with my children!” It was cool."

"bornewinner","216","Sun Jan 26 21:15:07 2020 UTC","May 23, 2010. The Suns had just won game 3 of the WCF against LA, 118-109. Kobe had 36, but went 2-8 from beyond the arc, missing his only two attempts in the 4th when the game was close. Game ended at 11 pm, and I had a few things to finish up before heading home. The way the arena was set up, the fastest route to the parking garage was to walk through the main bowl after leaving the office. As I make my way out at 11:30 pm, the lights in the arena dim, I hear a ball bouncing on the main court. I look to see who it was, and found Kobe out there shooting 3s. By himself. Top of the key, shoot, make it, get the ball. Back to the top of the key, shoot, miss, get the rebound. No coaches, no trainers, no teammates. Just the best player on earth, practicing his 3 point shot, alone. I sat down about 20 rows up, in an otherwise empty 18,000 seat arena, and watched one of the best five humans to ever play the sport practice in solitude for 25 minutes. After he had put up probably 75 or 80 threes from all around the arc, he grabbed the ball and went to the locker rooms. That night taught me so much about what it meant to be THE. BEST. About putting in work that no one sees. About perseverance. About never being happy with how good you are and always wanting to improve, even if you’re already the best. Kobe made a lifelong fan in those 25 minutes. RIP to one of the all time greats."

It's late May early June so yeah that's not happening so I settle for a PS2 a bunch of tech stuff and a big screen tv (I couldn't travel because my immune system was shot and I was afraid to ask for too big of a TV to tell you how innocent I was). Well....two weeks later I get a call. Who but Bean, calling me telling me he heard I wanted to meet him and how he was out there playing for kids like me and how he appreciated having me as a fan and to hang in there and I can overcome anything ect. It was only a 4-5 minute call but it lifted my spirits. I never told any of my friends about it, only my parents eve knew about it. I'm not saying it saved my life, but it gave me hope.... I had a ~20% chance for survival. That was 20 years ago. That man influenced the way I look at and attack life. I woke up this evening to the news of his passing and I've been crying on and off the entire time here at work trying to reason with myself ""hey this is just a basketball player why the fuck are you crying man get over it"" But I felt like a member of my own family passed.

Edit: There are people saying that his daughters were with him and there are people also saying that Rick Fox was with him so there is a lot of misinformation being spreaded now. As of now, the only person we absolutely know was on the plane Helicopter was Kobe so it's better to wait for some confirmation on the other people on the plane. Edit #2: 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks. Edit #3: Multiple sources are saying that Rick Fox is safe and well the information spread about him being in the helicopter is not true. Edit #4: There were 9 people on the plane including Kobe and his daughter Gianna. Three of them have been identified as Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife and his daughter"

TMZ Sports has confirmed. Kobe was traveling with at least 3 other people in his private helicopter when it went down. A fire broke out. Emergency personnel responded, but nobody on board survived. 5 people are confirmed dead. We're told Vanessa Bryant was not among those on board. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Kobe has famously used a helicopter to travel for years -- dating back to when he played for the Lakers. He was known for commuting from Newport Beach, CA to the STAPLES Center in DTLA in his Sikorsky S-76 chopper. KB is survived by his wife Vanessa, and their four daughters -- Gianna, Natalia and Bianca and their newborn Capri. Kobe has recently been spotted out at NBA games with his daughter Gianna -- a rising star basketball player herself. Their youngest daughter, Capri, was just born in June 2019. Story developing ... Edit: LA Time article https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas A helicopter crashed and burst into flames Sunday morning amid foggy conditions in the hills above Calabasas, with multiple fatalities reported. The crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road, south of Agoura Road, according to a watch commander for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The crash ignited a brush fire and made it difficult for firefighters and emergency personnel to get to the aircraft, he said. Sources at the scene said they believed there were multiple fatalities, but the exact number was unclear. The fire was contained to the crash site, officials said. There were no homes in the area, and no roadways were impacted. Edit: ESPN Confirms Kobe Bryant has passed away. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28569438/kobe-bryant-dead-helicopter-crash Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, 41, is among five people killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, a source confirmed to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Edit: TMZ Confirms Gianna Maria was on board the helicopter and died in the crash. 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks."

"bluescreenofdeathish","621","Mon Jan 27 13:05:19 2020 UTC","This may sound stupid... But if the pilot fucked up and is in this situation, can't he just fly up?

"Ozimandius80","2297","Mon Jan 27 13:54:28 2020 UTC","Yeah, people underestimate how much information we passively receive through the coordination of our eyes to our surroundings.

"BattlePope","1478","Mon Jan 27 13:28:40 2020 UTC","He thought he was at 1400 ft apparently, from the radar communications. Guess he didn't realize the cloud cover was so low and maybe made an idiot mistake reading 140ft at 1400ft or something. Edit: 1400ft above sea level which is only a few hundred feet above the ground in the area he was and not above some of the surrounding mountains. He was in a holding pattern that the guy described waiting for confirmation from flight control, and he stated multiple times his plan to maintain 1400 altitude and fly along a certain freeway (118). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0pQfgi9ZqU (better link provided by braedoktor and others who pointed out my old link was a repost farmer)... however could not link to exact timing, communication with the nearby airport (Van Nuys) starts at 2:37. Also, looking up some of the terminology, the flight controller asks more than once if he was transitioning under VFR (visual flight rules) and he confirmed he was. Which implies he was able to see which is obviously not true in the conditions. Don't know what that is about exactly. Then when he was handed off to the next control tower after getting cleared on the flight plan they didn't have good reception because he was so low and they couldn't advise."
"Ozimandius80","627","Mon Jan 27 13:41:22 2020 UTC","Keep in mind that 1400ft is above sea level, not terrain."
"keenly_disinterested","490","Mon Jan 27 13:45:41 2020 UTC","Yeah, I was considering that... calabasas is listed at 920 ft above sea level with the calabas heights up to 1391 ft above sea level. Pilot was advised to stay below 2500 ft and mentioned he was at 1400 then 1500 ft. so perhaps his instrumentation was off but I would think there would be advice to fly up a bit towards the 2500 ft level."
"Michelanvalo","117","Mon Jan 27 14:40:30 2020 UTC","This video depicts the flight path of the aircraft. The pilot was initially operating on a SVFR (Special VFR) clearance, which allows a pilot to operate an aircraft visually when the weather doesn't meet minimum visual requirements. Minimum VFR is 1000' ceiling with 3 miles visibility. Weather at Van Nuys was reported 1100' ceiling with 2 1/2 miles visibility. Keep in mind that ceilings are reported as altitude above the ground (AGL) while pilots report their altitude above sea level (MSL). Van Nuys field elevation in 800' MSL. The ceiling was reported at 1100' AGL, which is 1900' MSL, so if the pilot was flying at 1400' MSL he was some 500' below the ceiling. If you follow the flight path (and listen to the comms) the pilot flew along I5, orbited for a time east of Van Nuys while waiting for IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) traffic inbound to Van Nuys to land. Once all the traffic was cleared the controller handed the pilot over to Van Nuys tower. The pilot intended to fly north of Van Nuys, following the Hwy 118, then once west of Van Nuys he would turn south and pick up the 101 (Ventura Freeway) and follow it west through the canyon. Apparently he never made it to the 101 . It appears he made it to the 101, started through the canyon, and while in the canyon initiated a steep climbing turn to the left. The blip on the screen includes the aircraft's transponder data. The numbers on top are the FAA ID (N72EX), which the pilot uses as his call sign for radio comms. The numbers underneath show the aircraft's altitude and airspeed (add a zero to each number). At around 1:00, the aircraft is holding east of Van Nuys at around 1000' (which is just a couple of hundred feet in the air) but only flying 40-50 knots (around 50-60 mph). This is when he was waiting for traffic to clear. As soon as he was handed off to Van Nuys tower he accelerates to 130 knots. You can see the aircraft fly northwest, and climb to 1300' before turning west--presumably following Hwy 118--before calling Van Nuys tower. Note that the tower controller directed the pilot to tell her when he was either: a) in VFR conditions, or b) clear of her airspace. When on a SVFR clearance the controller is responsible to ensure separation between aircraft. The pilot is ALSO responsible, but the controller treats a SVFR aircraft like IFR traffic. At 3:35 the pilot asks the controller if he can turn southwest. He wants to turn that direction so he can find the Ventura Freeway, the road he will follow west through the canyon. The controller asks the pilot if he is in VFR conditions. The pilot says yes. Remember, reported weather at Van Nuys is NOT VFR, but the pilot now says he is in VFR conditions. His altitude at this point is 1700' and he's still traveling 130 knots. The pilot turns southwest to search for the Ventura Freeway. As the aircraft travels southwest it descends to 1400' and picks up speed to 140 knots. During this time the pilot is trying to get flight following radar service from SOCAL approach. Flight following is a service radar facilities provide to VFR aircraft when they aren't too busy handling IFR traffic. The controller incorporates VFR aircraft participating in flight following into the traffic flow, and warns the pilot of flight hazards (other traffic, airspace, terrain, etc.). You can hear the controller talking, but not N72EX, because the aircraft is too low for the receiver that was picking up these transmissions. The controller is telling the pilot he is flying too low to participate in flight following. The controller has a minimum vectoring altitude for each area under his control. This is the altitude below which his radar cannot maintain positive observation of aircraft. At 4:20, just seconds before radar contact is lost for good, N72EX begins a steep climb. The last reported altitude was 2100', 700' higher than the 1400' he was cruising at. Airspeed was still 120 knots. We don't know why the pilot climbed, but if you are flying in an area with high terrain and you accidentally fly into a cloud the first thing you should do is immediately climb and turn away from where you believe the high terrain is. The last few seconds of this recording does not jibe with this witnesses account, that the aircraft was flying very slowly. The last reported speed was 120 knots. If the aircraft was flying as slowly as this witness reports it would not have disintegrated on impact like it did. That looks a lot more like I would expect a 120 knot impact. EDIT: The data at this site comes from the aircraft's on-board ADS-B transmitter. You can see at the end the aircraft begins a steep climbing turn to the left while part way through the canyon the Ventura Freeway runs through. My guess is the pilot accidentally lost visual contact with the ground and tried to climb out of danger. Pilots learn (or should learn) early in training about the danger of mountain obscuration, where low clouds envelope high terrain. Attempting to fly through a canyon under such conditions can lead to a situation where the pilot is forced to climb into the clouds to avoid rising terrain."
"JimTheJerseyGuy","286","Mon Jan 27 16:44:51 2020 UTC","The flying very slowly part can be just be their distance in relation to the helicopter. An airplane several miles above your head traveling several hundred mph might not look like it's going very fast. Might be the same effect with the helicopter."
"J_Keefe","53","Mon Jan 27 13:48:22 2020 UTC","You are confusing AGL and MSL altitudes. AGL is above ground level. MSL is mean sea level. ATC communications regarding altitude are in MSL. The exact details will come out in the NTSB report but either the pilot was not maintaining altitude, had the altimeter set incorrectly, or simply became disoriented in instrument conditions."
"Paranoma","5407","Mon Jan 27 15:10:42 2020 UTC","simply became disoriented in instrument conditions. Flying into IFR conditions when you are VFR is one of the deadliest things you can do in an aircraft."
"DDRaptors","1043","Mon Jan 27 16:19:20 2020 UTC","No, as a helicopter pilot I can explain this. The aircraft was flying VFR, which means not on instruments. Helicopters are allowed to fly during daylight in the type of airspace he was operating in from John Wayne to the crash site in 1/2 mile visibility and clear of clouds. This is predicated on the pilot determining he is in fact flying in at least 1/2 mile visibility and clear of clouds. This is not easily done, because it can be difficult to tell whether your projected flight path will keep you out of the clouds and clouds are a kind of fuzzy looking beast in front of you, or hopefully above you, and it can be very difficult to assure you aren’t going to fly into a cloud or an area of reduced visibility up ahead. This is why you shouldn’t play with fire; just land, at an airport preferably or street, park, etc. The altitude read outs you see on these radar tracks are what the transponder reports which is Pressure Altitude, the height above the 29.92” Hg standard datum plane. This is essentially above sea level under yesterday’s conditions. So, if the altitude readout says 1,400’ you could actually be on the ground if the elevation where you are is 1,400’. What would be great is an Above Ground Level (AGL) readout, which can be determined by comparing the flight path with topographical maps. I am a pilot who flies in Los Angeles and knows SoCal very well. I know the elevations throughout most of SoCal. This pilot was flying as low as 150’ at numerous times throughout this flight. This was done to “scud run” and get through to his destination. This is unacceptable and a very dangerous practice. He had multiple chances to end the flight by landing, somewhere. He kept pushing through, into rising terrain westbound towards Calabasas. If you have bad visibility and ceilings in the San Fernando Valley you are definitely going to have a much worse time in higher terrain. It appears he flew into the clouds/fog shortly after. After realizing he was Inadvertent-Instrument Meteorological Conditions (I-IMC, or “cant see because he’s in a cloud”) he did the right thing by focusing on instruments instead, since he has no visual reference with the ground anymore. He actually began to do the right thing by climbing and starting a 180 degree turn. However, most helicopter pilots are not good at flying on instruments since we basically never do it after receiving the rating for the ability. There is a whole conversation of reasons why that is the case but is outside the scope of this comment. So the pilot likely developed Spatial Disorientation and lost control of the helicopter, which is indicated by the rapid descent in the last seconds of the flight. As a helicopter pilot this absolutely enrages me. How someone could flout company policy, standard procedures, regulations and exhibit no shred of professionalism to keep everyone onboard safe is beyond me. He could have just landed at Van Nuys and they could get a car service the rest of the way. I have done this a BUNCH of times, is a little disappointing when you can’t make it to the destination but this was some of the worst conditions we’ve seen in a long while and in the end: what are you doing risking people’s lives to please them? Just. Fucking. Land. Edit: Wow! Thanks for the gold!! Edit 2: I want to make clear in my post (as I have in responses to comments elsewhere) that this is my opinion only. My opinion based off of publicly available data, knowledge from having worked in the industry for 15 years, knowledge of the aircraft, having flown the specific type of aircraft, knowledge of the regulations regarding Part 91, Part 135, and VFR and IFR regulations, local knowledge being a pilot here, and being well-aware of the leading causes of accidents in the helicopter industry. I too am a Certified Flight Instructor and Instrument-Instructor in Helicopters. However, until the NTSB concludes their investigation and finds a cause for this accident then my opinion is only my opinion and not fact. I sincerely, and with all my heart, hope that the NTSB finds a mechanical irregularity led to this accident. Helicopter pilots are a very tight community and we are all brothers. I hope Zobayan is flying his favorite heli right now wherever he is."
"Paranoma","470","Mon Jan 27 17:27:30 2020 UTC","It’s insane to me. I fly for work all the time and we would never attempt to fly in such conditions. We don’t even fly with less than 7000’ ceiling because we go to mountain top sites that are around 5000’ and don’t ever want to fly in the fog/clouds. Our pilots and our company both refuse."
"MomentarySpark","224","Mon Jan 27 17:35:43 2020 UTC","Yea, that’s a bit excessive but yes it is the job of pilots to refuse a flight or turn around and land when in such bad conditions. Just because it’s legal doesn’t mean it’s safe, you can just end up legally dead. But being a Part 135 operation, which necessitates 300’ AGL minimum over congested areas, this pilot wasn’t even flying legal at times."

"Paranoma","313","Mon Jan 27 16:50:21 2020 UTC","Could you elaborate more on how the spatial disorientation led to him losing control of the helicopter? Was the maneuver to aggressive or do you think he ran out of room?"
"Gr33d3ater","132","Mon Jan 27 17:10:03 2020 UTC","No, it’s just very difficult to control a helicopter, or any aircraft for that matter, solely in reference to instruments. You must train and practice and remain proficient. In fact even if a pilot is Instrument Rated, the FAA requires a pilot have maintained a specific amount of proficiency within the past 6 months. If a pilot doesn’t remain proficient his rating is basically invalid and he must become current while practicing in VFR conditions only; after another 6 months of still not current it’s basically an invalid rating. So it’s difficult and you must remain current. Not-to-mention, most helicopters aren’t even certified for IFR flight, and certainly not one you would train and receive the rating in. When you do you are flying with an instructor but you are wearing foggy glasses to obscure your outside view. This means most helicopter pilots have never actually flown in clouds, even if they have the rating for it. Flying in actual clouds is very different because there are all sorts of visual illusions you will get, including vestibular illusions. You will feel as if your falling backwards, turning to the opposite side of where you are actually turning, feel as if you’re pitching up when you accelerate or the opposite when you slow. So, if a pilot pops into a cloud and doesn’t have a strong set of instrument skills and no experience actually flying in clouds then he may very likely become spatially disoriented and if he doesn’t absolutely ignore everything his body is telling him and JUST focus and trust the instruments, then he will lose control."
"MomentarySpark","77","Mon Jan 27 18:18:39 2020 UTC","vestibular illusions This and what you described reminds me of diving in murky water. You start seeing edges and corners/shapes where there are none. Like your eyes are trying to create them. You also feel dizzy/drunk without reference point so you have to focus on individual silt grains close to your face as you move. Similar at all or?"

I made a comment about how good it would be to get home today. The other (more experienced) passengers quite sternly told me to not put any kind of pressure, no matter how subtle, on the pilot. They explained he wanted to make us all happy and get us home. But far better to wait a few hours or a day and get home safely than put pressure on the pilot to try to take off when it wasn't 100% safe. Perhaps Kobe's pilot just pushed the envelope a bit too far."

The ‘flight envelope’ covers all probable conditions of symmetrical manoeuvring flight."" That envelope is the description of the upper and lower limits of the various factors that it is safe to fly at, that is, speed, engine power, manoeuvrability, wind speed, altitude etc. By 'pushing the envelope', that is, testing those limits, test pilots were able to determine just how far it was safe to go."

Visual flight rules into instrumentation meteorological conditions. It's the number one reason general aviation aircraft crash. They took off from somewhere the weather was clear so they didn't have an instrument flight plan in place. They were flying by visual flight rules. This works great until you fly into the clouds, then it's extremely easy to get lost and disoriented. If they had the opportunity they should have turned around when they saw the cloud layer approaching. They didn't. Once in IMC he should have climbed to an altitude that the terrain shouldn't be an issue, then have the air traffic controllers give them radar vectors to a safe space. They didn't. Such a shame. This is how Stevie Ray Vaughn died too. IMC straight into a mountainside. Completely preventable and absolutely tragic."

I’m not saying he was right to ignore morals and ethics, I’m just saying he can’t follow his morals without jeopardizing what’s more important to him which is money.

Unfortunately, people don't really think that way much anymore. Edit: Ok, this has gotten a couple of golds now, so I just want to say to anyone else thinking of gilding it: please don't. On a post about how morally and ethically repugnant China is, giving money to this site when it's backed by a number of Chinese investment companies (Tencent notably) strikes me as wrong. If you really are desperate to throw 5 bucks away, please just consider donating it to a charity of your choice.

An entire generation was molded by him, and now we have to carry that torch to help inspire the next generation of kids. I say Mamba Mentality to myself whenever I'm struggling to do anything, whether it be another rep at the gym, staying focused and in the moment, loving my wife, or at work when it's late and I need to slam out that time sensitive assignment.

Edit2: Some other reporters are also reporting his death, but they all seem to be refereeing the TMZ report. No additional sources. LA times twitter is telling people they are doing their best for independent confirmation. Edit3: International media is picking up on it, some pretty big publications like ""Daily Mail"". Journalist standards for those types of publications usually only do that if there are multiple independent confirmations.

His mindset was unique and I felt like in my life situation I approached everything with that determination and atill do. Such an amazing person and complete of achievements in success in everything in life.

I went to his last game. I celebrated his victories like they were my own. I remember that giddy kid I met in the NBC cafeteria when he went on Leno and asked if he could have one of my french fries.

Where I was watching 1 or 2 games a day, this season I've watched maybe 2. Love the man, I only wish that life allows me to somehow pay him back for everything he gave me."

"UnObtainium17","627","Mon Jan 27 15:44:49 2020 UTC","My favorite Kobe quote. Something we all can relate to in tough times. He said this to GOrdon Hayward after that horrible leg injury. “Be sad. Be mad. Be frustrated. Scream. Cry. Sulk. When you wake up you will think it was just a nightmare only to realize it’s all too real. You will be angry and wish for the day back, the game back THAT play back. But reality gives nothing back and nor should you. Time to move on and focus on doing everything in your power to prepare for surgery, ask all the questions to be sure you understand fully the procedure so that you may visualize it in your subconscious while being operated on and better the chance of it’s success. Then focus on the recovery process day by day by day. It’s a long journey but if you focus on the mini milestones along the way you will find beauty in the struggle of doing simple things that prior to this injury were taken for granted. This will also mean that when you return you will have a new perspective. You will be so appreciative of being able to stand, walk, run that you will train harder than you ever have. You see the belief within you grow with each mini milestone and you will come back a better player for it. Best of luck to you on this journey my brother #mambamentality always.” https://www.instagram.com/p/BaZQjy1gyv2/?hl=en"
"yurtyybomb","85","Mon Jan 27 17:42:03 2020 UTC","This is really apt and probably exactly what Kobe would say to us now, changing the stuff about surgery to be about moving on from death. The hardest parts, though, are the bits about ""recovery"" from a surgery vs. recovering from a death. Ugh."

When I was growing up, on Sunday afternoons there was an ""NBA Action"" program on TV in which we followed Michael Jordan's greatest accomplishments. It was awesome but I was a little young to fully appreciate the game and the GOAT. Fast forward to high school, my class is merged with the sports students curriculum and we have this friend of ours who is ALL Kobe Bryant. The only kid with a huge NBA Jersey in school, and in P.E. he does all the Kobe moves, and does them well. We bonded over basketball and I get back into watching NBA at 23pm, 00pm, 01am, just to see Kobe & company, and he was amazing. Became my favorite, even over Jordan. We haven't spoke >10 years, but today that colleague was the first person I messaged when I saw the news. He's crushed and so am I. RIP Mamba."

"MVP41","222","Mon Jan 27 16:04:27 2020 UTC","I’m an NBA fan moved to the US from China seven years ago. I just want to share how great influence Kobe Bryant has in China. Yesterday’s news hit me really hard, and I didn’t know how to process it. Many times, I woke up from sleep last night, and I still couldn’t believe that it was true. I opened my Chinese social media WeChat, and all I could see was that everyone was posting photos of Kobe and mourning for him. I mean literally everyone, from hardcore basketball fans to people who seemed to have no interest in the sport at all. Even my 85 year old grandma wrote something about Kobe. That’s how I realize Kobe’s legacy has went beyond countries and sports. MJ made NBA a global sport in the 1990s, Yao opened the door of NBA for the Chinese fans in the early 2000s, and Kobe was the face of the league in that era. It’s safe to say that Kobe is THE biggest international athlete in China. In the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games Opening Ceremony, Kobe was the only non-Chinese athlete who got over 10 seconds screen time on the CCTV (Chinese Central TV). After the Daryl Murray incident last year, the CCTV hasn’t broadcast one single game or any NBA news including the pass of David Stern. However, CCTV decided to air the news for Kobe this time. “Have you seen Los Angeles at 4 AM? I see it often because that’s when I start training.” Almost every Chinese basketball fan can tell you this quote from Kobe. “Los Angeles at 4 AM” has since become the symbol of hard-working and persistence in Chinese pop culture. Students studying hard for exams, workers working long hours, people from all walks of life have been using this phrase to encourage each other. They may not know how many championship rings Kobe had or who Black Mamba was, but Mamba Mentality has already planted it roots in a country thousands miles away encouraging people everyday to go out and be the best of themselves. I believe Kobe would be in his great signature smile if he knew this. Thank you ???"

"ListenBruv","459","Mon Jan 27 13:53:06 2020 UTC","I don’t post often on reddit anymore but I wanted to leave a message on this thread because Kobe meant a lot to me. I started watching basketball religiously in 1998 when I saw Kobe drop 33 points in one half against the Magic. After that, he was easily my favourite player. I followed the entirety of his career - I watched him get booed in Philly at the ASG, I saw him demand a trade, I saw players and fans turn on him, and then I saw the greatest redemption story in sports - the championships, the reconciliation with Shaq, and now, the mentor role he had taken with today's players. I have never dealt with death before and when I first heard the news yesterday I went numb. It sounded like a fake headline. I just kept saying ""WHAT?!"" over and over. Legends aren't supposed to die randomly at 41 on a routine flight to a basketball game. I cried seeing Trae Young's instagram post. I cried seeing Shaw crack. I cried seeing Jay Williams cry. It was okay to cry. This morning I woke up and it still all just felt like a dream. It doesn't sound real. It can't be real. Kobe - thank you for giving me some of the best moments of my life. Watching you hit the game winner against the Suns in 06 allowed me to yell and scream in jubilation at my brother who always rooted against you; seeing you win the championship in 09 allowed me to run around my college residence screaming at the top of my lungs; your final 60 point game allowed me to share my favourite player's last game with my now wife. You touched my life and my mentality towards success In so many ways. RIP Kobe and Gianna."

"henstobs11","686","Mon Jan 27 12:06:29 2020 UTC","Tried taking my mind off of what happened to Kobe and decided to go for a walk. In 2 hours of walking I passed by 5 public courts all packed with ballers of different generations, everyone wearing Kobe gear. Even passed by a group of guys pouring one out for the Mamba while watching highlights. Even when the news came out, my family members (except my dad who is also a bball fan) who know nothing about basketball, especially the NBA, came up to me and quickly asked me how I was doing. They know how much Kobe means to me. This is actually fucking stupid because I've never experienced grieving for someone. Grandparents died before I was born and the ones I grew up with up until now - my family and friends- are all still complete. Kobe's death is literally the first experience of grief I've ever had and shit's just so heavy. Never felt as bad as this even when other celebrities/musicians I idolized died. And I say all of this as a person who got into the NBA because of Shaq, yes when they feuded and Shaq was traded I was on his side and treated Kobe as the villain. From being a bench player up until winning an Oscar, I've followed Kobe. I went through all sorts of feelings from liking him, despising him, loving him but I damn sure respected him through all of it. I was so looking forward to Kobe's post-playing life. Shows, documentaries, commentating games, talk show appearances, mentoring new players, future WNBA courtside perfect attendance dad and now those are all just what ifs. Feel sorry for his family especially his wife, it's only been 6 months since the youngest was born. She has to go through all that without Kobe. I never want to know how it feels to lose a partner and a child at the same time and I hope nobody else does. Life is fucking brutal."

"Rockstar408","1919","Mon Jan 27 11:47:31 2020 UTC","I’ve never really been hit hard by a celebrity death before. But this one has really gotten to me. Kobe meant so much to me as a player and as a person. I will never forget that gut wrenching feeling I had when I woke up to the news of the accident. It’s also so incredibly sad that his daughter, only 13, didn’t get to live the life she deserved to have. You can’t help but think about what Vanessa is going through right now after losing her husband and daughter. This is just unbelievable, it hasn’t set in yet and I don’t think it will for a while. Although he won’t be there to make his speech, his Hall or Fame induction is going to be one to remember. The man was 41, he had just 4 years as a full time parent and he had a whole life ahead of him that he didn’t get to experience. Gianna’s dreams of playing in the WNBA and continuing on the Bryant legacy is no longer a possibility. She was a 13 year old kid, her life had hardly begun before it was taken away. Kobe, you were a true legend of the game and an inspiration to me and millions of others. You won’t ever be forgotten."

"DaeSd","505","Mon Jan 27 17:55:32 2020 UTC","Dear Kobe, You broke my heart. My Spurs flair alone is probably testament enough to that. I was just young enough that His Airness was starting to ride off into the sunset, so my entire childhood you haunted me (Derek Fisher and 0.4 notwithstanding) and after the three-peat I thought we were safe. But seeing you so effortlessly and ruthlessly handle teams, including mine, even in your down years, kept me checking under my bed for The Boogeyman wearing 8. I wasn't the only one you haunted. You came back. Really, you never left. From the mid to the late 00's you crept, you metamorphosed into a devil in purple and gold, The Black Mamba, Number 24. I thought you the Destroyer of Worlds. You willed 81 points into the history books using your blood, sweat, and tears. You dragged the ancient Celtic-Lakers battles of the past into the present day, kicking and screaming, and laid them bare before us, daring us to find a more important historical backbone to this league that we love. You were a historian, making history. Vino. A boogeyman less and less everyday, but someone who still found another gear, and made every game close when he visited the Alamo City in his twilight years. Even in your last year, the farewell tour you wanted to avoid, you pushed foes, stars, young and old, to their brink, even as you were hobbled and limped off the floor some nights. And then April 13th, 2016 you chose to burn your name into the stars one last time. All those hurts and pain you had inflicted when I watched you, they washed away for one night, and I was your biggest fan. We all were. You were down, the Jazz looked to have the game locked up, and the youngbloods on the team were passing you the ball so you could at least go out scoring in what looked to be your final loss. 4th quarter. 82-70 Utah. 9:38 left in the game. Left in your career. You had 37. Your J was gone, and I saw, truly, that you were just a man, heaving, huffing, puffing, drenched in sweat. But one last time, you wanted to be The Boogeyman. You kept finding the basket. I kept screaming in joy for this Laker dream crusher. It was almost a religious experience, I couldn't believe what I was watching. In what felt like a blink of the eye, you had 60 points, the Jazz had collapsed in the face of your immutable will, and the Staples Center sounded like it would come crashing down. Mamba Out. You left. The game was a little emptier. You became an elder statesman more and more everyday, and important to a new generation. You breathed life into a poem and won an Oscar. You were the next Bill Russell. I wondered what you'd say at his funeral. Your own Hall of Fame induction. But now? All I'm left wondering is what will Russell say at yours? Jordan? The Zen Master? Superman? Tim, Manu, and Tony? The King? What would Gianna have changed about the WNBA? What ripples would those other lost souls that day have made? Yesterday, you did it again, Kobe Bryant. You broke my heart. RIP Edit: Cleaned up minor grammar issues I couldn't see earlier through the tears."

I used to hate his sneer as he hit dagger after dagger; but then I grew up and grew to love hearing the eloquent way he would talk about the game, both strategically and psychologically. I was looking forward to his HoF enshrinement with Tim and KG more than just about any other basketball event in my life time."

I saw Shaq's son posts about the text messages Kobe sent him when he was going through surgery. It also hits me extra hard because I am a fairly new father. I was never afraid of dying before. Didn't want to die but it wasn't a scary thing for me. But then I had kids. The thought of not being there, of not being able to watch them grow and flourish and not being able to help them along the way scares me. My thoughts are with his family who lost him and a daughter/ sister. And also to the other families. This is already a difficult time and seeing photos of the wreckage on the media cannot help. Such a loss, so sad."
"flyingbeetlekites","2478","Mon Jan 27 11:55:01 2020 UTC","Mods deleted my post, so. Wrote this when he retired and it's the same reasons I hurt then why I hurt like hell now: I remember the first time I learned about the NBA. My family would go to Manila to visit family and as an eight year old, my instinct was to skip the hugs and kisses and head straight to my uncle’s computer cafe to play games. One of the games on the PCs happened to be NBA Live 2001. I am by no means an athletic child or a particularly adept gamer, but I was thrilled by the sport being played out before me. My older cousins had all chosen to play as the Lakers, so of course, I did too. They seemed the most debonair, with their gold jerseys edged with purple. A few months after, I saw my first NBA game. It was grainy footage played on VCR at a relative’s house. The game was May 13, 2001, Game 4 of Lakers vs. Kings in the Western Conference Semifinals. At one point, a slim guard with an afro missed a layup then fought through 3 other players (all taller and bigger than him) to get his own offensive rebound and make the basket in his second try. He was, in a sport meant to be played as a team, an individual. Even then, #8 struck me as selfishly absorbed in the game. This man--playing a sport I knew nothing about and in a country over 8,000 miles away from mine--understood what it was to have a singular purpose: to win. I was ten years old when my family moved to America. I started 5th grade in December and tried to learn how the country worked. I would spend everyday at recess walking back and forth on the concrete edge between grass and woodchips, talking to myself. At home I’d go on YouTube and watch the viral videos of the 00s--Numa Numa, Badger Badger Snake, Smosh, and--of course--basketball highlights. Eventually, I learned where to find live streams of games. I read articles and studied every statistic. I went on basketball forums and blogs and learned how to trash talk with the best of them. Being a Laker fan made me feel part of a community, even as I remained alien at school and in my actual community. Being a Kobe fan helped me feel alright with that. Kobe never seemed to care about his teammates. He never seemed to care about glory or fame. He did not even seem to care about being labeled a criminal all that much. During that time, he looked mostly irritated that his mind had to be preoccupied with something other than basketball. It was comforting to watch someone be so consumed with not failing that he drove himself to heights of greatness beyond what he was supposed to. It was encouraging to know that someone can be so consumed by not failing that he often drove himself to failure. I cried myself to sleep because my classmates made fun of my accent. Then I spent hours reading books and looking up how unfamiliar words were pronounced. I would say them over and over until I pronounced them correctly, like an American. My mother would open my door and ask why I was talking to myself. I learned how to make relevant cultural references, what music to listen to, and made friends. I was quickly seen as the straight-A nerd, a leader in the community and the various clubs I was in. I graduated high school in three years and made it to a top public university where I found success as a student and in my job. All effort was made into a singular purpose: to win. I worked so hard and was so consumed with not failing that I drove myself to insanity. Every perceived failure was a devastating blow to my ego. I would beat myself up over and over until I got it right. Through it all I watched Kobe going through the same experiences. The triumph of a made buzzer beater that would win us the game. The tragedy of trying to take over because he would not bring himself to trust his teammates, so he would end up making 21% from the field and lose the game for us. During games when he was missing every shot, Kobe seemed unable to control himself. He would keep firing missed jumper after missed jumper. I’m not gonna stop, the blank stare seemed to say, until I get it right. When I read his retirement letter, I cried. I cried not because basketball is losing one of its greatest players, or because he never did surpass Jordan. I cried because when I watch basketball next year, I’m going to look out into that court and no longer see a kindred spirit. So, to Kobe: Thank you. Thank you for having a will so stubborn that for years, you would not accept you were human. Thank you for a goodbye letter that was not addressed to your teammates, your fans, your family, nor your friends, but to the sport. Thank you for the sincere love you have for what you chose to do. Thank you for having no other purpose other than to over-achieve. Thank you. Because even though we, with you being a 6 foot 6 inch tall incredibly athletic black man and me being a 5 foot tall completely unfit and slightly chubby Filipina woman, could not be any more different, we carry a same singularity of purpose that made me feel less alone. Always, A fan. *EDIT: Thank you for the silvers and gold and the supportive comments. It helps that I'm not alone in mourning. Hope everyone has a good day."

Anyway, I didn't want to fangirl or anything. I just kinda lined up our paths and held out a fist as I walked by. He fist bumped me and gave a little nod. And that was that. Just a dope little memory of mine that he surely never remembered but I never forgot. Always seemed like a genuine dude who was always aware of his impact/influence and always used it in a positive way. Not much more you could ask for in a public figure."

He was a different kind of star. Most athletic stars do things that we didn't think were humanly possible. But Kobe did things that we didn't think were possible from him he accomplished things by a sheer force of will that he was written off from doing. Like hitting 2 free throws with a torn Achilles, or putting up 60 in his last game. RIP GOAT"
"vinvin1313","70","Mon Jan 27 17:04:07 2020 UTC","I assured my wife last night that I was sad about this loss a LITTLE bit but not like I was seeing everyone else reacting to it, and mind you, I'm a huge Lakers and Kobe fan. My wife, not being largely into any sports in general, wanted to know what was so great about this guy that people are feeling like this. I explained that his achievements as a player are unquestionably worth all praise but ultimately it's just a game and there are far greater things to shed tears about... Then, after a long pause, I said, ""I'll tell you what DOES make me sad about this is his family..."" and suddenly I burst into tears and I couldn't stop crying and I couldn't talk and my wife, surprised, starting quietly crying too. After a little composure, I explained that the saddest part to this story is his family, his wife, his other daughters, who finally, after taking a back seat, patiently waiting for Dad to chase his dreams and silence his critics and slay his demons, FINALLY get Dad to themselves, only to get three brief years, no doubt the best three years they've had as a family thus far, to now have to find it in themselves to try to move on and try to carry the torch of the ""Mamba Mentality"". I feel so sad now and I get the sadness everyone is feeling. It forces me to grieve my personal losses because it's not the games he played that's causing people's grief. It's the mortality we all face, the realization that unfortunate events cannot be tamed or stopped or bought or influenced by fame, fortune, goals or good intentions. He was no angel, not perfect, but he acknowledged it, and worked hard to redeem himself and his family. I keep thinking about his last moments and as sad as the images in my imagination are, I certainly hope there was little to no suffering and I hope that being with Gianna made it a little easier for each other. It breaks my heart. I'm so sad. May the Bryant's find peace and comfort soon."

When I got to college, I wasted away my first quarter with more of the same bad habits I had in high school. Then I watched a postgame interview of Kobe's. And I got into watching more of his videos. The things he said resonated with me. A lightbulb clicked. His message remained constant: ""Put in tireless, relentless effort, and you'll have what you want in life. I guarantee it."" So I did. I spent hours locked away in the library, studying. When I felt like quitting, I asked myself what Kobe would do. And I got my reward. Dean's list, graduated with honors, and a good job out of college. Those are Kobe's honors, not mine. And honestly, they don't even matter. What mattered was the satisfaction of knowing I gave 110% effort. Win or lose, I tried my best and I wouldn't have regretted it regardless of the outcome. I may never have met him, but he impacted me and I'll forever be grateful for him. I'll sum up the wisdom I gained from Kobe for anyone who needs it: Put in the work, put in the time, be obsessed with whatever skill you want to get better at or goal you have for yourself. Let it dominate every thought in your head. Constantly ask yourself how you can improve, even a little bit, today. Ask yourself this every day. One step at a time, keep moving forward. Don't worry about yesterday or about tomorrow, just about taking that one step today. Soon you'll look back and wonder how you got as far as you did"

After a while I decided to hate the Lakers and ”hating” on Lakers was a lot fun because Kobe was so freaking good. I have a lot of good memories of him and I’m grateful to have seen his whole basketball career. I enjoyed still seeing him near the game, like just a while back when he was courtside and shared a moment with Luka. When I got the news I was dumbfounded. I couldn’t believe it. It got more real during the day today. I was keeping the tears in for the whole day at work and when I got home I just let it out. Couldn’t help it. I was surprised... here I am; 36 year old male, crying for a dude I never even met. But I feel like I knew him. I feel like I’m part of a big basketball family today and we all mourn together.

I had an addiction problem, was severely depressed, and had no positive prospects in my life. I spent a lot of nights watching Kobe highlights, watching interviews with him, wishing that I could be like him, or at least have a fraction of his mentality about life so that I too could be a winner. He's always been my favorite basketball player since childhood; I had Lakers gear because of him, one of favorite birthday presents ever was a Kobe signature hoodie and track pants set. During his last season, I got to finally see him play in person for the first time. I was in the nosebleeds and it was just a midseason game, but it was still magical. I was glued to my laptop screen watching him hit 60 during his farewell game, which was so inspiring. I'm doing well today and all of that seems like a distant memory now (including my own troubles) but Kobe was always a lighthouse for me, a perfect example for how to be. I love you Kobe, thanks for everything, I'll miss you and I wish your family strength as they get over the loss of an amazing father and daughter."
"Sushi2k","37","Mon Jan 27 15:53:35 2020 UTC","It still doesn't feel real. Basketball has been a huge part of my life ever since I could remember. Even though I spent my 26 years rooting against him and his team, I still had an enormous amount of respect for him on and off the court. Kobe was a different kind of person, there was just something about him. A killer instinct that only a select few athletes have. His personal drive could be felt through the TV. It always felt hopeless when you saw him get going and it was spectacular (also depressing for my team) to watch. I cried on and off all day yesterday, watching/reading all the teams, players, coaches, celebrities, friends, family, and strangers across every sport, fandom, hobby, entertainment medium, and social media sites give tribute to Kobe, his daughter, and the others that were on board. Kobe transcended basketball and sports all together and showed us what hard work can do for someone, Mamba Mentality. Now, as I'm fighting back tears writing this, sitting at my desk, next to my large picture of Jordan guarding Kobe, I feel almost empty. Something is missing, and it won't be filled for a while. I've never owned Laker merch outside of the Lakers Shaq jersey my friend gave me in middle school as a joke (which I buried deep in my closet and never wore) but I think I'm going to break that streak and go get a Kobe jersey in his honor, maybe I'll shadowbox it, who knows? I'll never stop saying your name whenever I'm at the park or throwing away a ball of paper Kobe. I miss you and the basketball world won't be the same without you and your daughter to make your marks. R.I.P. Kobe Bryant and Gianna Bryant"

I’ve been lucky that I’ve never had to deal with a loss of a loved one or family, I never thought someone’s passing who I never even met would hit me so hard. I thought I had things under control until my Dad texted me. “You have probably heard the news about Kobe by now. One of the best of nights of my life was seeing him go off and sharing it with you. I still have the tickets.” This was a game in 06/07 my that my Dad took me too. Kobe scored 60+ right in front of us. I had no idea my Dad looked at that night so fondly. Reading about how much Kobe loved being a father made me realize that my Dad felt the same way. These small moments we as kids might take for granted really do mean the world to our parents. I turn 30 in a few weeks and this whole tragedy has really made me take a step back and reevaluate what’s important in life. I don’t have much more to say, this is all still very difficult.

But I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t have dumped a body in the Hudson if it meant 20 years of Kobe playing in the north east. He was everything sports should be about. A guy you either love 100% or hate 100% and no in between. But he played the game in a way and left a mark on this sport and this world that is really unmatched and never will be matched. This is truly a devastating tragedy that puts life into perspective in such a fucked up way that you’re reminded of how beautiful it is to be able to celebrate and witness a player like Kobe and how very very important it is to let the people who care about you know you care about them. That’s all that matters in life. RIP Kobe And these are the men we should cry for and celebrate and Prop up and be immortalized for the legendary human beings they were before their life tragically ended. Kobe transcended basketball and seeing him after retirement was just so beautiful to see him enjoying every minute he got to spend with his family. No family deserves to lose their husband and daughter on their way to a basketball game Sunday morning but knowing it was Kobe and his daughter is so surreal. I figured Kobe would just beat the grim reaper in 1on1 forever. He will love on forever thru his basketball accomplishments but Kobe the father and husband is no longer able to be with his family for the rest of their lives and that is truly heartbreaking for me"

I don't think there's another player in our generation so touched by the game, who lived it so completely, who immersed themselves in the history of it, and who was ready in their role to see the sport evolve and curate the wisdom and combined knowledge of the game for those to come. I've been taking this hard. I eulogized him the only way I know how: a morning shootaround workout as soon as the my gym opened at 5 am. I think he would appreciate his death leading to more appreciation for the game. RIP Kobe Bean Bryant"
"StrikerApexSet","34","Mon Jan 27 16:13:15 2020 UTC","I grew up watching NBA during the Jordan era and slowly watched legend after legend retire until in my mind all the legends had retired, I stopped watching the NBA as being in Australia and without cable it wasn't convenient enough for me to continue to watch. I would always hear the name Kobe, would see his highlights, see him on the cover of games but didn't know anything about Kobe apart from that. My younger brother then got into the sport and he fell in love with Kobe & the Lakers, he would pass his time after work watching Kobe highlights and looking for Kobe merch. His mood will change based off how the Lakers went, If they won I would be forced to watch the game winning play, forced to watch his interviews until it reached a point I was a part of the fandom. Me and my brother bonded over Kobe, last yeah we had the honor to listen to him talk live in Melbourne, he just seemed invincible, live another level of human, strong and bulletproof. Today I was shocked waking up to find he wasn't in fact bullet proof, I had to make my way to my brothers and wake him up to tell him the news, i felt a responsibility to break it to him the same way I felt the responsibility to break the news to him of family passing in the past. He was asleep and i called his name 3 times and he just ignored me so I just said ""Sorry Bro, Kobe died in a helicopter crash"" he jumped up in shock, we would always joke with each other and try to trick each other about believing the stupidest lies but he didn't question this, this wasn't something to joke about. We just sat in silence and from time to time would utter What the fu...... I was a passing fan and am heart broken, I can't imagine what his hardcore fans are feeling let alone his family, it's unbearable to think of his final moments with his daughter, I can only imagine him being clutch and looking to keep her calm in her final moments. RIP Kobe & all on board."

"Notacheesefan","35","Mon Jan 27 17:31:13 2020 UTC","Sweet, a chance to pour my heart out with out sounding like a complete lunatic. Kobe, you had no idea who I was, we met briefly when I was a kid. My dad took me out to Lower Merion (only about a 15 minute drive away from where I grew up) to watch your number get retired. I remember the smile you had on your face as you autographed that basketball, the infectious energy you gave off that I couldnt yet fathom at that age, but some how stuck with me even to this day. You had no idea who I was, but you meant so much to me. So much to so many kids growing up in Philly. You gave us the mentality to believe that we can be anything in this silly old city even when the situations around us taught us otherwise. ""basketball is the best metaphore for life"". You said that. That quote has been engraved in my brain since the day I heard it. You and your ""next play"" mentality, your competitiveness to always be great through every trial and tribulation, and to never let your past define you, always move on to the ""next play"". That is the metaphor you left for us and that is the metaphor I plan to carry through out the rest of my life. I was so excited to make it out to the basketball hall of fame this year and see you finally make it into the HOF. I had this crazy plan to seek you and tell you how much you helped me through out my life and that you truly were a huge role model in my life. I guess my crazy plan now is to go to honor the impact you've made in my life, although you had no idea who I was. R.I.P Kobe Bean Bryant."
"iloveyou271","90","Mon Jan 27 16:46:33 2020 UTC","The truth is, I kinda passionately hated Kobe for most of his career. I found him to be a cocky asshole during his time with Shaq, and then I felt he wrongly ran Shaq out of LA. I viewed him in a even more negative light after the Eagle Colorado incident. During his two finals appearances against the Celtics, I took great pleasure in straight up loathing his existence. And yet, I always had nothing but incredible admiration and respect for his game. It wasn't until his final NBA season where I started to soften my stance against the man. I felt sad he was leaving the NBA. I was happy when the Celtics fans chanted his name as he left his final game in Boston. And then, as I watched him bloom in retirement, I kinda started to love the man. I embraced his Italian upbringing (I'm Italian- American and have spent a lot of time in the country). The way he still spoke Italian so well. The fact that he named all his daughters Italian names. I was moved to tears when he spoke in Italian towards the end of his Oscar award acceptance speech. It wasn't until post-retirement that I saw what he really was. Cocky and brash? Sure. But also insanely intelligent, funny, a man with a huge heart, cool, and living a hugely purposeful life with his countless important endeavors. I straight up became a Kobe fan in recent years. I'd watch his talk show appearances with a smile. Man, I kinda love this dude now, I thought to myself. Even after rooting against him for so many years. I've been completely shaken since hearing the news of his death. It's the combination of the shock of it all, his age, the way he died, and how much he still had in front of him. He worked his ass off to crush it in the NBA for 20 years. Now was the time where he could enjoy himself. Pursue cool endeavors and raise 4 daughters with his wife. Give his HOF speech later this year. Watch his kids grow up, get married, have their own kids. Be a mentor to countless basketball players. Continue all the other cool shit he was doing. That's all gone in a blink of an eye. And it's unfair. Life is unfair. Countless people die young and leave us unexpectedly with so much more ahead of them. A lot of people will say that Kobe accomplished so much in 41 years. And while that is obviously true, it doesn't make it any easier to accept this tragedy. I guess the only thing I can take away from this is to pursue my own dreams. Something I'm guilty of not doing. Something Kobe always seemed to be doing. I don't think any of us will ever truly get over this. It's an enormous loss for the NBA and for the world. I bought a Mamba Academy T-Shirt an hour ago. I will wear that shirt to the gym and think about Kobe and his work ethic and use it as a tool to motivate me towards my dreams. My heart goes out to all the Laker/Kobe fans on this sub. My heart goes all out to his family and friends. Life is fragile and unpredictable and unfair. We gotta honestly try to live every day as best as we can and put the BS to the side for good whenever possible. Much love to you Kobe and Gigi. Godspeed and God bless. Edit - Thank you for the Gold and the kind replies."

"yerfrigginbrother","25","Mon Jan 27 16:10:41 2020 UTC","I'm 27 -- grew up watching and idolizing Kobe as did everybody in this community. Yesterday I sat and stared at the tv for longer than I should have, reeling from the news. Decided it was time to get up and work out to take my mind off it, so I went to the west side YMCA in manhattan. Between sets I walked into the court to checkout the pickup situation. Multiple younger kids wearing Kobe jerseys, and I saw more than one fadeaway accompanied with a ""Kobe"" callout. Almost made me cry, but amazing to see the impact this man had on kids too young to have seen him in his prime. That's how you know we lost an absolute legend yesterday."

"Nagasasaki","26","Mon Jan 27 16:38:33 2020 UTC","As a Kings fan, Kobe was our most hated rival. I remember my whole family thought he could never do right. He was always arrogant, cocky and selfish. Even my aunt who lived in la would talk shit to the only laker fan in our family. My best friend loved the mamba. We would hang out everyday over summer and we would play ball in the streets and everyday he would try to recreate a new signature mamba move or moment. We would play 2k and he would always use the lakers and shoot lights out with kobe, using that signature mid range turn around fader. As I became an adult i realized big of an influence he had on the game i loved. In my final years of high school i could only play in Kobes. He had the best signature shoe line and the 8s will always be my favorite model ever. I bought his asg 5s soon after and played in them till they fell apart. I remember his final game, where i was housesitting for my coach. I watched every single minute and in his final interview, i sobbed my eyes out. He felt like a rival that i had grew up with. I had not known the NBA without Kobe Bryant. I did not grow up with Magic, Bird and Jordan, so Kobe was the only GOAT I’ve seen play. He will be missed dearly by the world. Goodbye Mamba, may your legacy continue with these young stars that you have influenced so deeply."
"Nti11matic","25","Mon Jan 27 16:42:48 2020 UTC","When you said, ""This was felt in every errant paper ball or contested mid range jumper at the local Y."" I felt that. No really. I felt that. RIP Kobe. I still can't believe it."
"softroxstar","25","Mon Jan 27 16:46:36 2020 UTC","For me, since I wasn't necessarily a Kobe fan, the impact has more to do with the NBA. I could see that he was a student of the game. He lived and breathed basketball. I was a fan of his Detail segments on ESPN. I could see that he wanted to enrich others who shared the same love as him, although I cannot see anyone reaching that same level of dedication and love for the game. When I heard that he handpicked NBA players to attend his camp before the NBA season, I knew that he wanted to better the NBA. He wanted to get the best out it's impact players. He wanted to build a pristine product, and gave back to the sport that provided so much for him. I was always a Kobe hater, but only because he was the brick wall that held back my Houston Rockets. After he retired, I became a Kobe admirer. After realizing what he was doing to better the sport, I became a Kobe lover. RIP Mamba. You deserve to be immortalized."
"nickdoy89","26","Mon Jan 27 17:12:10 2020 UTC","I never rooted for Kobe when I was younger. Being from the Bay Area and a Warriors fan, we rooted against him and hated his continuous domination of us and the rest of the league. I just turned 30 this past year and it was the first time in my life a death of someone I didn't know, made me cry. Kobe was more than a basketball player to me (and my generation of basketball fans). He was THE face of our generation. He was bigger than basketball and he was invincible. Now that I've gotten older, I've become a fan of who he became off the court and in his post-association life. He had so much more planned and it's unfair he won't get to see it through. Rest easy Kobe, Gigi, and all of the other victims of the crash. Gone, but won't be forgotten!"

After basketball, you strived for more, you never quit Turning basketball into film, even mastering it. Imparting your wisdom on players young and new, Tennis, soccer, all athletes trying to be just like you But your greatest accomplishment? Your family hands down. You were setting Gianna up to take the throne, the crown, Seeing your greatness turn to happiness with your family, Reminding all of us how human such greatness can be. Kobe, please know that you won more than ships, You won the hearts of a city, a country, a world; my own. In the city of angels, you have become their angel, Thank you, for being one of the greatest ever known. Sincerely, A Basketball Fan"

Mainly because most I knew have just been musicians who I briefly listened to. But with Kobe it's something else man. It's so different with Kobe because I endlessly watched him. Like I knew him. Imitating his moves in the gym with my friends. He inspired me. All my life the only thing that I've invested my free time in was basketball. Whether I was watching it or playing it. I was never too dedicated to movies or shows, just basketball games. I never put my focus on any other hobbies. So this one hits differently."
"nj_legion_ice_tea","21","Mon Jan 27 16:06:31 2020 UTC","When I started watching the league around 2006. I hated Kobe. I've never despised anyone like that in sports. I saw him as a selfish, stuck up villain. Then he dominated my Suns in the 2010 WCF, it broke my heart. I was even fed up with his farewell tour. And then, I saw Dear Basketball. I watched him sit down with Shaq. I watched him care for all the young guys. I watched his jersey retirement. I watched him talk spanish to people. I watched him work out, and sit courtside with Gigi, and be a proud dad. I listened to Jalen's stories about him. I watched him talk to Luka in his own language. And I grew to like him. Started watching more interviews, even going years back. I was proud, as a basketball lover, to see a family member win an Oscar. I was rooting for Mambacita, couldn't wait to watch her dominate, and see Kobe proud on the sidelines. We started to see the invincible, mysterious become a mortal, one of us, a simple dad - caring not just for her family, but all these kids who grew up idolizing him. He gave all he had, and went just as mysteriously, as his career. I'm heading out to hoop in around zero celsius now. Love the game, and love each other people. We're all family."
"Clutchxedo","20","Mon Jan 27 16:42:03 2020 UTC","I just want to promote Vince Carter’s postgame presser for people that haven’t seen it. I was floored by it and everything he had to say was just tragically beautiful. He is gonna have a hell of a career in TV after he retires. Today has been a tough one. It’s like some immediate family has died. Every time I think about it I’m gut wrenched and Gigi is just making it a million times worse. I know Kobe would have given anything for her not to be involved. We just saw how they were chilling at all those NBA games weeks ago. And that another kid and her parents went too is just too much to handle. Something that really stood out to me, from one of The Athletic podcasts I heard earlier, was that Kobe wasn’t this old head talking about the old days and how weak the league had become. He truly respected, cherished and embraced the next generation of players and genuinely seemed to enjoy the game in its current state. That he will be inducted in the Hall of Fame posthumously seems bizarre. RIP to all 9 onboard. RIP to my hero - you will be missed. You was supposed to be court side at Staples for the next 40 years. Can’t believe it. Love. Edit: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UST_RSXcjBc"

Today, the road all runners come, Shoulder-high we bring you home, And set you at your threshold down, Townsman of a stiller town. Smart lad, to slip betimes away From fields where glory does not stay, And early though the laurel grows It withers quicker than the rose. Eyes the shady night has shut Cannot see the record cut, And silence sounds no worse than cheers After earth has stopped the ears. Now you will not swell the rout Of lads that wore their honours out, Runners whom renown outran And the name died before the man. So set, before its echoes fade, The fleet foot on the sill of shade, And hold to the low lintel up The still-defended challenge-cup. And round that early-laurelled head Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead, And find unwithered on its curls The garland briefer than a girl’s."

"iFinesseThePlug","922","Sat Feb 15 18:03:15 2020 UTC","Loved how supportive Kobe was of players who came after him. A lot of former players whine about missing the old days, but Kobe always wanted the game to thrive."
"YouCantBeSadWithADog","443","Sat Feb 15 18:04:57 2020 UTC","So passionate about the game. All he wanted to do was share his knowledge with everyone. He was like the father of the NBA."
"iFinesseThePlug","269","Sat Feb 15 18:10:24 2020 UTC","And I'm not even talking about as a teacher or mentor. Kobe wanted the game of basketball itself to succeed and inspire others. He pushed himself into the role of an active ambassador of the sport and a passive symbol for what can be achieved."
"dboti","162","Sat Feb 15 18:33:37 2020 UTC","How much his death affected fans globally really shows how much of an ambassador to the game of basketball he was."
"YouKilledKenny12","115","Sat Feb 15 19:25:35 2020 UTC","And not just basketball. You saw how much of an impact he had on a lot of famous athletes and other celebrities. Look at Neymar and Djokovic’s tributes for example."
"jamphotog","103","Sat Feb 15 20:09:06 2020 UTC","I have a friend who is currently working as a teacher in a fairly small city in western China. He said when Kobe passed it was like a day of national mourning. The school he taught at held a special prayer at their assembly, and had a vigil for him in their gym. He said that the entire school attended, many people were in tears. I don’t think I know of any other American, much less American athlete, to garner that type of reaction from people in such a seemingly remote part of the world. Long Live Mamba."

And that's how Achilles wanted it. Whether Kobe truly felt that way we'll never know."
"EPIC_Deer","12","Sat Feb 15 22:46:56 2020 UTC","Yeah Achilles seems the better comparison, unfortunately...."
"ItsGettinBreesy","119","Sat Feb 15 18:08:56 2020 UTC","It’s so crazy to think about the transformation of Kobe over the years. He went from the villain to the hero, from disliking players to being a heavy proponent of the growth in the WNBA and training players. It goes to show you how age and maturity can give you humility"
"22Savage671","5","Sun Feb 16 01:09:57 2020 UTC","I talked about it once, and that's part of the reason I love Kobe so much. He improved himself as his career passed, as you said. I hate how people like to bring up his 2003 scandal, yet people forget he was vilified by the media and lost a bunch of endorsement deals (part of the reason he is with Nike now). Most people who do bad stuff, they usually do it again in the dark. But Kobe learned from his mistakes and his experience, and I believe he really redeemed himself because he really loved his family after. Especially when he retired, he focused a lot on them willingly. Truly an amazing human being. Thank you, Kobe."
"stfu_whale","7","Sat Feb 15 19:24:45 2020 UTC","Whenever I saw him helping Celtics players, I hated it because it felt like he was helping the enemy when the Lakers were in such a sad state, but now I appreciate what he was doing. Passing down his knowledge so basketball could always move forward and evolve was a noble goal."
"ryuhwan99","21","Sat Feb 15 18:27:23 2020 UTC","He loved the game too much. He always wanted the next generation to have the same mindset as him and even learn some of his techniques, like he did from jordan. After he retired he reached out to so many people ( young or not ) to just talk about the game , about the mentality. That's insane man, he may be gone but his impact on the game is everlasting."
"madxspence","3","Sat Feb 15 21:01:48 2020 UTC","I like sports history, so I won’t doubt that part of the game has become soft, but on the flipside, part of it has become more complicated and shifting towards more positionless players. Kobe was wonderful in the fact that he wanted the sport of basketball to succeed no matter how it changes. He was willing to share his knowledge so that basketball could be taken to an even higher level. He showed appreciation for the guys that came before, and the guys that came after and that looked up to him. Basketball lost such a great ambassador. :("
"Freakazoidberg","94","Sat Feb 15 18:18:14 2020 UTC","I've broken into tears multiple times for the past few weeks trying to put into perspective of why its effecting me like this and this is kinda how I see it. I honestly didn't think it would hit me this hard. I had his jerseys up on my wall in my room at my parents place since high school (33yrs old now). It was like a freakin shrine of the dude. My wife used to make fun of me for being such a fan boy especially since I never hero worship celebrities.. but this guy wasn't just a celebrity. He was the reason I fell in love with this game. He was my connection to this game. If you've been a fan of the NBA during the 2000s, chances are that you saw Kobe's face almost on a weekly basis for 20 years (even if you're not a Lakers fan); He was always on sportscenter or some other highlight package. He was always there. He was the embodiment of reliability. Not many things are reliable in life, but he said ""fuck that"" and showed up every night. He was the guy you could count on to put on a Hurculean effort when needed, and even sometimes when it wasn't needed. He wasn't just a connection to the game for a lot of people, he was the game. I am holding onto LeBron now to carry on that larger than life embodiment of the game."
"b3x_grant","34","Sat Feb 15 19:07:34 2020 UTC","Pretty much how I looked at it. Think about it. He came in the league at 17 and retired at what 37? We not only grew up with him but we watched him grow too. For 20 plus years he’s been all in our homes whether it’s on TV, video games, posters, phones. And it’s been great to see him grow Not just as a player but as a man. For the final few years of his career it was surreal to watch him change from this killer, to an ambassador of the game, giving back, providing us documentaries not only on his psyche basketball wise but as a man. We started seeing Kobe transition into the family man ready for his next chapter with his family where you can just tell how happy he was. And his daughter was in love with the game too and we were all gonna watch her grow and him teach her the game as well. This wasn’t just an athlete. This was an icon. On and off the court. I remember my heart dropping when I read the headline the first time. This empty feeling. I’ll never forget it. People have been saying it’ll go away over time like every celebrity but i really don’t think I’ll ever get over it. I think I’ll always just have a moment where it hits me that “man, Kobe Bryant is dead”. This is gonna hurt forever. Rest easy Bean ?"
"Freakazoidberg","11","Sat Feb 15 19:12:45 2020 UTC","You put that so much more eloquently than I could. It’s the fact that we saw a 17 yr old cocky kid grow up into a man and a father. A guy who went from having a perpetually angry scowl on his face to the warmest smile when he talks about the game and his daughters. He was in this zone that he created for himself and played in that mindset for 2 decades and he finally stepped out and opened up so much for everyone. So damn heart breaking."
"IAmNewSam","13","Sat Feb 15 19:14:01 2020 UTC","Growing up in LA without a father in mid 90's and being a big fan of basketball, I would be heavily remiss to say he wasn't an idol, a role model, and a hero all in one. The impact he had on so many people from all over the world is incredible. And that he managed to do so primarily through his love of the game of basketball makes it more inspiring. Even without ever meeting face to face, or ever talking, he taught me a lot about what it means to be a man, what it means to work hard, how you turn a dream into reality, and how you can always will a bad situation into a good one. Importnatly, he showed me what it means to grow up. We watched him go from the plucky 17 year old we saw taking brandy to prom and airballing late game shots to a guy who was reknowned as a basketball assassin, the most skilled player of his generation, a man with a will of pure steel. We watched him grow from a kid who eats McDonalds too much, to meticulously caring for his body to maximize his career length. He was a real one for sure, not many people are able to be so purely themselves and be able and ready to share that with everyone else to the extent he did. Not only that, but the pureness of his dream, despite his massive success, was also consummately special. So much so, when he described this love in the form of an animated short, it received the highest awards honors possible, an academy award. Rest in Peace Bean, you'll be missed forever."
"TheG2apist","3","Sun Feb 16 02:02:48 2020 UTC","Oof, right in the feels man. I grew up in LA without a father either and this man was the role model I looked up most to. I had other role models but Kobe was always the personification of that killer and baller. I thought I was done weeping but Jesus. Rest in peace KB8/24."

"barath_s","18","Sat Feb 15 18:51:15 2020 UTC","I mean MJ mentored kobe. To the point he was giving him tips in game.. Plus he had his basketball camps , I guess"

"Bellis_Mango_Cart","5","Sun Feb 16 02:39:12 2020 UTC","Sure but MJ also didn't have a daughter to drag him back in like gianna did. Kobe was dead set on ignoring the NBA for his family. He and his family earned to have him back at home"

I was in middle school and seen how he worked his fade away, fuck, I used to practice it for hours after school. Watching Kobe play, even on his bad games, I felt my blood rushing and anticipating what fucking genius play he was about to do. I fucking cried bad when I found out. He was like a friend I never got to meet in person, but I had a connection with. This life can be fucking bull shit, and this is one of those times."
"grumpy_youngMan","3","Sun Feb 16 00:51:35 2020 UTC","this is my main counter-point to everyone who says 'naming an award after kobe would be reacitonary and stupid'...he literally inspired a whole generation of players, and his story is amazing enough to inspire future generations as well. there might have been better players overall (maybe a small handful), but kobe has to be top 2 or 3 in terms of how many people he's impacted. and if you think the league is better off naming awards after former league administrators / accountants / lawyers then i dont know what to say..."

"cherryripeswhore","39","Sat Feb 15 17:05:19 2020 UTC","I feel the same. Kobe was one of the few to open up and share his life philosophy with the public. He literally made you feel that you too can accomplish what you want even if the odds are stack against you. He was/is still a great role model. It is still tough even though it's been sometime."
"MDequation","10","Sat Feb 15 18:43:52 2020 UTC","I bought his book (The Mamba Mentality) over a year ago, but I've read it more times in the last 20 days than I have the whole year. Highly recommend anyone to get it if you like his artistic style and wanna be inspired."
"EnragedOhm","7","Sat Feb 15 18:46:00 2020 UTC","Bought it when it came out! Definitely a great read."

"DefrancoAce222","7","Sat Feb 15 19:15:37 2020 UTC","That was an amazing part for sure. My favourite bit is when he's talking about how he's defending AI in the Finals - counting out the seconds for how long it takes him to make his move and using that information to disrupt him as the series wears on.. Some things you just don't think about when playing until Kobe expresses it, just incredible."
"schumonsta","10","Sat Feb 15 21:16:41 2020 UTC","One thing I love about his philosophy is that it can be applied to any goal. The Mamba Mentality can be used trying to kick ass in college, at work, side projects, training, and even your personal life. It’s even the small things like sleeping and meditating that he always talked about that can make a big impact in one’s life. He’ll never be considered just a ball player. He was a visionary."
"DefrancoAce222","3","Sat Feb 15 22:00:17 2020 UTC","I attribute many of my successes in life to the mamba mentality. Growing up in LA and watching every game, listening to Stu Lantz, and watching all pre&post games just made me idolize Kobe. I literally felt that anything was possible. I was homeless for a while, dropped out of high school to work full-time at 15 and support my family, but I wanted to graduate college still one day. I forced myself to get a GED, then community college, followed by uni, and I have my dream job working fully remote. I did the work, but I was so inspired by Kobe. We weren’t ready to lose him. He had so much more to teach. “The good die young” rest in piece, mamba."
"TheQnology","52","Sun Feb 16 03:29:50 2020 UTC","I feel that bro. Think the best thing many of us can do to honor him is to apply his mentality to our own lives. That why his philosophy lives in many. Congrats on your success!"
"3500fp","31","Sat Feb 15 17:20:45 2020 UTC","To be clear: he wasn't just a hero. He was not somebody you just admired. To me, at least, he was that person who you thought about when I was pulling overtimes, he was me working hard for my company that I barely know, he was me giving it my all when I thought I had nothing left to give, he was that, not a hero, but somebody I could be more of in my life."
"GreyBlur57","66","Sat Feb 15 17:09:06 2020 UTC","I’ve saved a few of his quotes bc I feel like I can use them in my life and sure enough I can. It still doesn’t feel real man"

My username is based off of me throwing grenades in freaking Call of Duty when I was 13, thats his impact"
"Meowjin","19","Sat Feb 15 17:50:19 2020 UTC","Feel the same about when Roberto Clemente died.

He had that crazy 40 pt streak with some 50 and 60 pt games thrown in. IDK if we’ll ever see such a stretch of scoring dominance from one player like Kobe did again."

Balling up paper and shooting it in the basket at school when the teacher not looking and saying ""kobe"" while your friend tries to block it and saying ""shaq"". Have all of his shoes, most recently the Lakers colourway React AD NXT's. Just unreal"
"PaulPiercesShorts","8","Sat Feb 15 20:48:25 2020 UTC","I'll never forget when the Nets played the Lakers and Kobe managed to put a few minutes aside to talk with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, who grew up in PA and idolized Kobe as a kid. It was his rookie year. Rondae said Kobe told him to ""fall in love with the mid range game"". A season or so later Rondae, in what was his best season of his career, came out knocking down mid range jumpers left and right. Prior to that he was scared to even touch the ball on offense. I think he averaged like 14/7/3 that year. When guys say that the man shared what he had to offer it's the truth https://www.nba.com/nets/sites/nets/files/rhj_kobe_760x480-05.jpg"

"Busted08","3","Sat Feb 15 23:33:00 2020 UTC","It’s still weird as fuck. Everything will just be sort of normal (whatever that happens to be for a given day) and then just like a punk bully who runs by people, slaps them in the back of the head and runs off laughing like they’re tougher than everybody. You’re doing whatever, and then...fuck, man...Kobe and his kid and their friends and that pilot all died in a fucking helicopter crash. Like, no. This is some “alternate” reality casually mentioned via news broadcast in a bad Sci-Fi movie or TV show. That’s how you know the main character is in the alternate dimension. On Earth Prime, we’re watching Kobe cheer on his daughter, shooting a game-winner for UCONN in the Finals. Or the Sparks in the NBA. But the hero just walked into a diner they vaguely remember, orders a beer and while making small talk, “Today, a tragedy in the sports world...” And the hero is, “WHAT THE FUCK?!” And everyone is all normal about it. Like it’s just something that happens. “Yep,Kobe died in a crash.” “Nah, fuck that...I gotta find a magic stone, or young Bruce Willis, or Jerry O’Connell, or somebody from FRINGE. This shit has to get fixed ASAP.” 9/11 made more sense than this. I don’t know why. They’re just people. People die in all sorts of crashes all the time. But this...I wasn’t even a huge fan. But...it just feels...wrong. In a way I can’t shake."

"RichieW13","32","Wed Jan 29 22:49:41 2020 UTC","Yeah, I don't think it makes much sense to chase the 24 points in the second quarter. Maybe as soon as late in the third quarter you would want to start collecting ""8's"" instead of ""7's""."

"RedRubberRadio","27","Thu Jan 30 19:59:18 2020 UTC","The format is a modified Elam ending. I personally hope the NBA adopts it as a format in the future. Current basketball end game is dumb as hell. Elam’s goal was simple – to try to create an endgame sequence where basketball actually looks like basketball instead of watching one team walk up the floor to shoot free throws and another team race down the floor to jack up threes. The Elam Ending accomplishes that mission because trailing teams who would dare to commit intentional fouls would be gifting their opponents an easy victory. Instead, they are required to play tight defense (as they would for the rest of the game) and try to get stops while scoring at the other end. One of the best examples for the benefits of the Elam Ending came in the game between the Scarlet and Gray (Ohio State alumni) and the Matadores (Texas Tech). The Ohio State team held a 75-70 lead when the Elam Ending began. With a target score of 82, the Scarlet and Gray led 80-73. The game ended with an alley-oop dunk that brought the entire gym in Columbus to their feet. Now here is the relevant question for sports fans – would you rather watch a game-winning, walk-off alley-oop… or would you rather watch the Matadores foul on four or five possessions in a nearly hopeless, time-consuming waste of everybody’s time? I would be willing to wager that at least 99% of fans would prefer the first scenario, unless there is someone out there who just really, really enjoys the art of the intentional foul. With the Elam Ending, every single game is guaranteed a game winning shot https://thecomeback.com/nba/the-elam-ending-is-the-best-thing-to-happen-to-basketball-this-century.html"
"wearepimpsnohoes","184","Thu Jan 30 20:10:44 2020 UTC","I've never heard of the Elam Ending before and didn't know it was a thing. Thanks for the article. Personally, I'm glad the NBA is following the NFL's lead and trying out different wacky rules for the All-star game, like the 4th and 15 onside in the Pro-Bowl this year. This sounds like a fun concept so it'll be interesting to watch how it plays out with NBA players."
"FluffyMoomin","232","Thu Jan 30 20:12:51 2020 UTC","This seems complex but it actually makes sense. The goal is: 1) to make each quarter competitive, with real stakes, and 2) to make the 4th quarter exciting by eliminating the run-out-the-clock strategy and ensuring that there's always a game-winning shot Yes, this is unfamiliar. But I think bball fans will understand very quickly when they watch the actual game. Compared to dribbling, fouling, and other aspects of bball, this is super simple"
"LeatherFart","175","Thu Jan 30 19:06:30 2020 UTC","Whoever is leading after 3 quarters only has to score 24 points to win it. The team that’s behind has to score more than 24, to reach that total."

"Not_Jabri_Parker","120","Thu Jan 30 19:22:32 2020 UTC","It’s not really reseting the score. It would’ve been clearer if they said $ will be donated each quarter to the team that scored the most points in that quarter."
"LaMarc_Gasoldridge_","13","Thu Jan 30 21:26:01 2020 UTC","Yeah that would've made more sense, but resetting the score makes it feel like another game so maybe the players will care more."
"BasedGodProdigy","776","Thu Jan 30 22:01:59 2020 UTC","Yeah I think resetting the score will help players forget about the overall game and care more about winning each quarter. For example is a Khris Mid heats up at makes a few threes in the the 2nd quarter to win it he gets a lot more exposure then if he just made the score go from 81 to 90"
"LuckysBestMan","280","Fri Jan 31 01:26:07 2020 UTC","The other team is also more likely to defend him properly if the three's are making it 33-30 Team Giannis rather that 90-81 team Giannis"
"jiriwelsch44","215","Thu Jan 30 19:03:11 2020 UTC","Wait what? So sorta like the Big 3 but what's the point of the first and 2nd quarter if it just resets? Ok, it's explained in the article. There’s at least $500,000 for charity at stake from the game alone. Each of the first three quarters is worth $100,000 — if there’s a tie, the money rolls over to the next quarter — and the final score is worth another $200,000. If one team sweeps all four quarters, the other team will receive $100,000 for its charity regardless. Interesting format..."

"crazygoattoe","193","Thu Jan 30 19:55:07 2020 UTC","points are reset to determine QTR winners. All scores will be ""added back"" at the start of the 4th QTR. Highest score + 24 pts will be new target score to win the whole game."
"hacky_potter","59","Thu Jan 30 19:14:32 2020 UTC","Love this. Actual article here from the tweet - https://apnews.com/d465010625f8118c5fdbf8e05103d21c This is what I got from it First three quarters: score is reset to 0-0 each qtr. Winning team of just that qtr gets $100,000 donated to charity. 4th quarter: total scores of the game are back. So if West beat East 30-25 in each of the 3 quarter, 4th quarter would start at 90-75 like a normal game. To win the game, you need to reach the score of whichever team has the lead in the 4th + 24pts. So in that example, first to 114 points wins. No game clock in the 4th quarter. Hope that makes sense. Pic breakdown: https://twitter.com/MarcJSpearsESPN/status/1222962234403573760/photo/1 Looks like $500,000 given away to charity total. $100k each for first three quarters, $200k for the winning team"
"h723456","26","Thu Jan 30 19:28:39 2020 UTC","This makes far more sense now and seems kinda fun. They need to find a better way to simply explain the concept though because the one-sentence description makes it sound really dumb lol"
"hacky_potter","24","Thu Jan 30 20:08:18 2020 UTC","I feel like people will catch in fast once it's played. I think winning Quarters might make the game more competitive."
"geiko989","17","Thu Jan 30 21:18:28 2020 UTC","Also I like the streetball/big 3 rule where you play to a certain score instead of the clock. I’ve always wanted to see NBA players play that kind of game."

Thanks for explaining it. Hopefully people will read this before complaining about stuff addressed in the article"
"[deleted]","117","Thu Jan 30 19:37:03 2020 UTC","I think obviously a lot of people just read the title (as expected) and assumed the 4th qtr just starts 0-0 and nothing matters. I know everyone still won't like it, but I'm excited to see how it goes. It's been boring lately with every game being 0 defense ending 201-181"
"Frigidevil","62","Thu Jan 30 20:01:46 2020 UTC","I usually am not one for big change but I like this...it's the all-star game. Might as well end on a game winner with the ultimate suspense piling up."
"[deleted]","25","Thu Jan 30 19:27:49 2020 UTC","It basically guarantees every game will have clutch shots and tough defense towards the end instead of players just turning it into a shitty dunk contest"
"playthegame7","309","Thu Jan 30 19:41:11 2020 UTC","And the hope is they will actually give a shit if they're playing for charity."
"protothe","105","Thu Jan 30 19:48:54 2020 UTC","Also imo the game should always be associated with Kobe (bc his legacy was about always taking these games seriously, he holds the all-time record with 4 ASG MVP) and I think if players keep that in mind they’ll always play hard and respect the game as competitors."
"bkervick","41","Thu Jan 30 19:02:48 2020 UTC","Thats an odd format to say the least"
"BigDickolasNicholas","12","Thu Jan 30 20:42:43 2020 UTC","So the 4th quarter is gonna be 4-5 minutes long? I get the tribute, but shortening the game isn’t what’s best for entertainment."
"guitmusic12","723","Thu Jan 30 22:02:43 2020 UTC","If the losing team makes a comeback they will have to score more than 24 points. But yeah, will be shorter than usual almost assuredly. Hopefully they play defense in the 4Q."
"MacDerfus","62","Thu Jan 30 22:20:00 2020 UTC","If they don't play defense it'll be that short... So probably. But hey, at least they're trying something different. If it doesn't end up being better they'll just go back to the old formula next year."

"jkure2","28","Thu Jan 30 19:26:12 2020 UTC","The good thing is we will always see a game winner Plus it forces the guys to play defense"

We’d just finished a few games of pick up when we got back in time to watch the Warriors and Kobe’s farewell at the same time. By halftime the warriors game was such an afterthought. People in our dorm heard us going nuts over every shot Kobe hit though. We ended up with probably 15-20 people crammed in this tiny dorm room to watch the last couple minutes of Kobe’s career. An incredible memory in my life that I owe to Kobe."

"VenomSnake4","1203","Mon Jan 27 19:54:41 2020 UTC","I’ve been wanting to share this story somewhere over the past 24 hours, but I couldn’t find the right spot until now, so here it goes: I was on a bus with my high school choir heading down to Florida for a week long trip. Due to Kobe’s final game being later in the night, and because I didn’t want to piss off the chaperones, I reluctantly slept through the game and went to sleep at 10 PM. When I woke up in the morning, my phone was dead and I didn’t have a mobile charger, so I couldn’t see the results of the game until we got to a Golden Corral for breakfast. When we got off the bus, I asked one of my friends how many points Kobe put up. He said “60.” I thought he was pulling my leg like he was known for doing. Keep in mind, this is a 37 year old Kobe who put up around 15 PPG in 2016. I tried to call him out on his bullshit, but he kept saying “no, I swear, he put up 60.” We get into the Golden Corral, I plug my charger into my phone, and what do you know, the motherfucker put up 60. I watched nothing but highlights while I ate my meal in disbelief. To date, this game was my biggest “why the fuck didn’t I watch that live?” moment as a sports fan. If I had known what would happen to Kobe, I would’ve risked getting kicked off the bus and skipping the trip just to stream the game at a truck stop somewhere in South Carolina/Georgia. RIP Mamba, we will all miss you."

They're also giving us all something that we can watch together that could be a cathartic moment. However, they're still going to make money from the advertisements that are run. I'm not saying that they shouldn't, they are a business and that's what they do. Now, if they donated all the ad revenue to a Kobe charity, then it would be selfless and not about money."

Odom having just recovered from his near fatal over dose and being shy hiding amongst the ex players didn’t want to impose himself and when Kobe saw saw he breezed right past the other guys straight to Odom and gave him a massive hug as the Staples let out a cheer. The fact that many players would’ve turned their back on someone in Odoms situation due to not wanting to tarnish their own personal public image yet Kobe didn’t give a shit and visited him at the hospital and what speaks volumes about him as a friend, teammate and leader. https://youtu.be/K-vYrd1JQOE.

This is not true. Kobe's lawyers were allowed, by the judge, to bring up Faber's name. The Court and the Eagle County Justice Center's staff accidentally leaked the name. http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/judge-dont-call-kobe-bryant-accuser-victim Prosecutor dismissed a witness, without telling the defense, simply because he contradicted their evidence. The sexual assault expert claimed jaw injury and vagina trauma are very much possible in consensual sex. Why is this so important? Prosecutor's entire case was predicated on the neck injury and vaginal trauma. Weirdly enough, this is never mentioned among news sites attacking Bryant. http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/09/03/authorities-defend-handling-kobe-case.html The accuser had sex hours after her encounter with Kobe Bryant. However, before you guys try to use the ""Sexual assault victims can be very unpredictable"" card, (Which is somewhat valid) before this evidence was revealed, the accuser and the prosecutor's stances differed strongly from this. To exemplify, prosecutor tries to fight this evidence by saying she had sex BEFORE the encounter, but the forensic expert was very doubtful. If she had sex before the Kobe incident, there would be some DNA found on Kobe's clothing; Nothing was found http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/us/papers-reveal-new-details-in-kobe-bryant-rape-case.html https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/ Before the actual trial took place, including the civil court, the accuser bragged about the money she was going to get from Kobe. . You know what's worse? 3 days before Kobe was charged, she was seen by more than 5 people bragging about her encounter with Kobe. http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-bragged-partygoer-happy-article-1.512242 http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/11/06/docs-kobe-accuser-discussed-award-money.html Her ex-friend reveals the accuser had celebrity addiction for a long time. She tried to do the same thing to Eminem. She also wanted to testify: http://www.contactmusic.com/kobe-bryant/news/ex.pal-reveals-kobe.s-accuser-plotted-to-lure-eminem-into-bed She was seen leaving the hotel without any noticeable discomfort: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kobe-records-released/ She had a history of mental illness that was dangerous to herself and her peer: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.showbiz.gossip/n2cprdAFQJE (This evidence would not be accepted in today's court but was registered in 2004) The prosecutor lacked evidence. Not only evidence, they were badly losing against Kobe's defense team: ""This ruling will make it much, much tougher for prosecutors to convict Bryant of sexual assualt,'' says legal analyst Cohen. ""The physical evidence against him never was that strong to begin with and now this evidence is likely to tilt the 'he said, she said' battle squarely in Bryant's favor."" https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/ The accuser lied and changed her story multiple times. I am okay with giving accusers the benefit of the doubt, but this was alarming. Because there was a witness who saw her without any visible discomfort (This is my assumption), she claimed she was forced to wash her face and settle down before leaving Kobe's room. What's even worse? she was given a chance to correct herself months after the initial statement; she continued the lie. She didn't admit to her mistake for a whole year. http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-mixups-admits-lies-claim-article-1.548757 Finally, the settlement. People actually use this as Kobe's confession. Kobe was strongly advised by his own defense team AND other prosecution to settle this case. Why? He could risk losing everything, and it does not help that he's a black man. If he didn't settle, it would take years for this case to conclude; his wife also had a miscarriage during this time. When you settle a case, it's a compromise with you and the defendant; you don't think the accuser wanted Kobe to say those things? To substantiate this, the accuser asked for ""unspecified amount of money, as well as public vindication."". She got both in the settlement. The accuser is the one who wanted this comment. Its what the lawyers, from both sides, agreed to make Kobe sign to end it; it has nothing to do with Kobe's actual feelings or the reality of the case. This is a settlement. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-09-28/news/0409290017_1_accuser-lin-wood-kobe-bryant By all accounts, this was a false accusation. I will never say I am 100% certain, but I am sure enough that he did not rape this woman. It's really funny how the media changed narratives to fit their agendas. I have never seen them bring up how much the prosecution was insanely unethical to Kobe AND many of his witnesses. The prosecutor, Lin Wood, is also a horrific person. POST IS STAYING"

"MrMallow","386","Fri Jan 31 04:11:23 2020 UTC","Honestly I get that it was over a decade ago, but I live in the community in Colorado where Kobe raped that girl. I was here when it happened and I remember him saying ""I understand how she could have 'mistakenly' seen it as rape"". I remember him denying ever knowing her until they got him with DNA evidence and he changed his story. Him implying that since he didn't see it as rape that it didn't count and she was so terrified by the event and media frenzy that she didn't want to testify so he got off. Just because he went on to have an amazing career doesn't mean it never happened. Our community certainly never forgot. EDIT: the amount of apologists messaging me is astounding. He raped a 19 year old girl just out of high school working in the hotel he was staying at, she was to scared to testify (as is common in rape cases) so it never went to trial. I literally live in the community it happened in (then and now)."

"MidAirMan","3","Fri Jan 31 16:08:19 2020 UTC","I think this is why a lot of celebrity have learned to not have sex with fans. Kobe and any prominent athlete have it thrown at them.

"ashwee_","62","Fri Jan 31 06:22:12 2020 UTC","Just because you ""literally"" live where this happened doesn't mean shit btw. Things like this happen all over the country and the only reason your community hasn't forgotten is because of a famous name, because believe me there are women out there who's cases are long forgotten and never saw justice and their communities have moved on. Moreover, it never went to trial like you said so it's concerning that you are viewing those who are questioning your source of information as apologists, and this is after you misquoted him drastically and presented this information as reason for everyone else to assume his guilt. Rape is horrible and fuck him if he did it, but you are being unreasonable."
"_cuntard","26","Fri Jan 31 06:31:34 2020 UTC","you live in the community it happened in? so fucking what? unless you were a witness to the alleged rape, your speculation is as (in)valid as anyone else’s."
"EmotionalCrit","22","Fri Jan 31 06:16:16 2020 UTC","""It totally happened guys, I was there!"" Do you know how many people on this website have tried the exact same stunt you're pulling? You wanna guess how many people can fool anyone with it? I honestly don't care if you lived there or not though. That doesn't make you the source of absolute truth on the matter so quit beating it over our heads like it does. You're allowed to have your own opinions on what you think he did, but that's just what they are. They're not facts, they're just you asserting that he did it because you say so and then calling the people who disagree with you rape apologists. This is not rape apologia or deifying celebrities. This is completely justified skepticism from people who have already seen false accusation after false accusation falling against other guys, especially famous or wealthy guys that play professional sports (Brian banks, anyone?). An especially disgusting tactic is to drop the accusation after they've expired, so you can cash in on the media attention of your bullshit survivor story when the accused can't even defend themselves. ""Cancel culture"" uses this tactic a lot. Without a trial, he can't be considered a rapist in the eyes of the law. I give absolutely zero shits about her being ""scared"" to testify, that's what happens when we run this bullshit ""don't tell rape victims to report"" campaign centered around protecting people's sensibilities at the expense getting justice and punishing rapists. If it truly happened to her, she should have reported it. I say this as the victim of two sexual assaults and an attempted rape. Report it. The potential to get victim blamed or re-traumatized is a small sacrifice compared to what might happen if you let your rapist walk free. There's ways to make the process less difficult for survivors that doesn't involve encouraging them to avoid prosecuting their rapists or defending their decision not to."
"TheLewdGod","36","Fri Jan 31 05:38:32 2020 UTC","the amount of apologists messaging me is astounding. Not really even a little. Your misquoting someone in an attempt to frame them for rape. I don't personally believe he did it, I believe that she didn't want to testify because she wasn't telling the truth. But, because neither me nor you can really know, and the only thing we do really know is that the court system treats rape victims like garbage, there's a chance you're right. There's also the chance that she is in a position to 'cause significant harm to his career, his image, and his overall wellbeing, using this to improve her own financial wellbeing. I guess the reason why you're receiving so many messages is because of the sheer sureness that you have, like do you have evidence that's not freely available that we're missing? Could you share it?"

"Cuntfart9000","18","Fri Jan 31 07:36:24 2020 UTC","People should read the wiki of this case During the July 2003 interview with investigators, Bryant initially told investigators that he did not have sexual intercourse with his accuser, a 19-year-old woman who worked at the hotel where Bryant was staying. When the officers told Bryant that she had taken an exam that yielded physical evidence, such as semen, Bryant admitted to having sexual intercourse with her, but stated that the sex was consensual.[2] When asked about bruises on the accuser's neck, Bryant admitted to ""strangling"" her during the encounter, stating that he held her ""from the back"" ""around her neck"", that strangling during sex was his ""thing"" and that he had a pattern of strangling a different sex partner (not his wife) during their recurring sexual encounters. When asked how hard he was holding onto her neck, Bryant stated, ""My hands are strong. I don't know."" Bryant stated that he assumed consent for sex because of the accuser's body language such as her kissing him, putting her hand on his penis, and bending over, but that he did not explicitly ask for her consent during the encounter. Bryant later said that he believed his accuser was capable of saying no because during the encounter he asked her if he could ""cum on her face"", and she said no."

If it were in this time, where any woman can say that she was raped by someone (even if she wasn’t) and the dude she accuses us fucked, it’d be a different story. Highly doubtable that it was a fake rape report. Also a possibility that he paid the family off to drop it.

"Fireboy759","29","Sun Jan 26 23:01:58 2020 UTC","Imagine living a healthy, good life. You got a promising future ahead of you. You're physically fit. And it's pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things but you're pretty rich. Life's good, right? Then suddenly, your life gets taken. You die through an accident that was no fault of your own. That future you had ahead of you will never be realized now. All that remains is the ever-lingering thought ""What if?"" To die so young is a great tragedy indeed"
"iGotEDfromAComercial","159","Sun Jan 26 21:14:50 2020 UTC","I think this is the first celebrity death where I’ve gotten chills reading the news. I think it’s kind of like when Micheal Jackson and Robin Williams died, but most of us weren’t old enough to process the news."

"iGotEDfromAComercial","38","Sun Jan 26 21:18:33 2020 UTC","Yeah, same probably with Juice and XXXTentacion, it was surprising, but with them I don’t think I reacted quite like this."
"highimjelena","28","Sun Jan 26 21:42:24 2020 UTC","yeah i get that, juice was my whole life so thats why i felt so deeply about it. But like the fact kobe had a family and died w his daughter on the way to her basketball practice , like that gives me goosebumps bro"
"-B_R_U_H-","11","Mon Jan 27 00:06:05 2020 UTC","This is bigger than Juice Wrld and X.. Kobe was a household name. You could ask the oldest person in the world who he was, and they'd probably get it. This is devastating, I can't imagine the reaction this will bring when more people find out."

"alpha_brav0_charlie","21","Mon Jan 27 08:23:09 2020 UTC","He was in a defensive posture, he kept intentionally running into him, so as he swung the first time he gave a little push... then he swung harder and gave him an elbow to hold him off. I don't think Kobe was in the wrong here at all."
"nushublushu","15","Mon Jan 27 08:13:06 2020 UTC","Yeah but that's just a friendly dick slap between bros"
"EpsilonRider","34","Mon Jan 27 07:17:20 2020 UTC","Kobe definitely set him up for it though lol. Even if you hang on the rim, you always naturally just swing forward at least a tiny bit. But Barnes definitely saw him there and could've held on until his momentum swung backwards before letting go. But that's just me armcharing the situation lol."
"djokov","33","Mon Jan 27 10:18:43 2020 UTC","Kobe 100% knew what he was doing. One of he few ways to pacify a player who is much better than you is to unsettle him by playing rough. Kobe played into the fact that Barnes was attempting to do this and deliberately set himself up for the fouls to happen. His completely unfazed demeanour served to fuel Barnes' aggression and frustration levels. To me that's not unsporting, it's just smart. At the end of the day the fouls are still fouls. Avoiding them often leads to the fouls not being called as well."

"echte_liebe","579","Mon Jan 27 04:24:30 2020 UTC","It's knowing there is no way in hell Barnes would ever in a million years actually do that to him. Maybe to someone else, but not to him. Barnes knows it'd be the end of his days so blinking is not even a concern."
"Smugjester","940","Mon Jan 27 05:06:14 2020 UTC","Yeah but still, it's involuntary to flinch. It's mind boggling to me."

"sam_hammich","74","Mon Jan 27 05:46:17 2020 UTC","It's also a thing fighters do as well like when someone is punching them (or trying to) and they can't just flinch and make a stupid face. If I had to speculate tho Kobe knew he wouldn't do it (as said above) and for sure knew he couldn't let someone like Barnes make him flinch. Kobe knew he either had to get hit by the ball or call the bluff. Man was a fucking legend and will forever be remembered as such by me."
"j0y0","48","Mon Jan 27 06:43:07 2020 UTC","No but like, it was so fast he wouldn't have been able to think about it. His lizard brain would have been thinking ""you're about to be hit in the face, close your eyes"" before he had a chance to actually react. What's crazy is that he was so confident, he didn't even have the subconscious self-preservation instinct to flinch. That goes beyond confidence."
"HunterTV","180","Mon Jan 27 05:50:27 2020 UTC","Watch it closely: he shifts his stance a bit and turns his head to the right while making it look like a nonchalant shift of his weight to his left foot, he's not looking directly at the ball, which might provoke an involuntary reaction like a blink or flinch. It's exactly like what he does the other two times he gets fouled in the OP clip: shift weight to left foot, look away to the right, stay calm. Only difference between the other two times and the fake pass is with the first two fouls the aggression persisted long enough for him to slowly put his hands up into the air."
"cuttlefish10","97","Mon Jan 27 05:22:10 2020 UTC","Not to diminish the man but I think there are times when you're pushing yourself physically the flinch response gets harder to trigger. At least that's been the case with me personally when I've been doing something and sweating my balls off and something like a car backfiring would normally make me jump but my body was like, ""yeah I can't be bothered right now."""

"YKTN","33","Tue Jan 28 20:48:55 2020 UTC","I agree. We have to consider those players may have personal reasons for wearing those numbers as well. I know in Orlando, ross changed his number to 8 this season and Khem Birch has been wearing 24 ever since he got here. I think they both keep it until their time here is over."
"Truesday","198","Tue Jan 28 20:52:05 2020 UTC","When I see a 24/8 or 23, I see it as tribute to those OG players. If a player personally want to pay respect by not wearing the numbers, by all means. I hope this doesn't pressure players to not wear numbers of players that inspired them."
"Halos2594","510","Tue Jan 28 20:19:14 2020 UTC","Personally, I don't want every team to retire Kobe's numbers. To me, people wearing #8 & 24 will help preserve Kobe's legacy more than others not wearing it. Unless they copy the way baseball does Jackie Robinson day where every player wears Jackie's number 42 on their jersey once a year."

"litmosis","82","Tue Jan 28 20:51:02 2020 UTC","The problem that I’m not sure how they’d work out is refs refer to players by their numbers when they hand out fouls. I mean it’s obviously do-able but not sure how much it’d slow the game down etc."
"asentientgrape","79","Tue Jan 28 22:31:24 2020 UTC","Kobe's not Jackie Robinson."

"Turkeys2TurkeysCrust","22","Tue Jan 28 22:58:51 2020 UTC","Jackie Robinson's #42 is the only situation where I really endorse league-wide retirement. I think that a player's legacy needs to truly transcends the world of sports, as Robinson crossing the color line did, to deserve that level of honor (Clemente too, maybe). As much as I loved Kobe (that past tense stings), and as much of an inspiration as he was to kids all over the world, he wasn't a straight-up HERO like Robinson was. Only a small handful of athletes ever, I think, deserve such an honor, and most of them didn't wear numbered jerseys."
"Jahgee1124","602","Tue Jan 28 19:22:26 2020 UTC","Let players do it individually if they want, it being done formally by the league/teams is too much IMO"
"RaphBenYisrael","224","Tue Jan 28 19:32:47 2020 UTC","Yeah, I love Kobe but I don't this is a great way to honor him. In fact, I think it's more of an honor for players who grow up wanting to wear the same number as there favorite player. I mean, LeBron wore number 23 because of Michael Jordan. I always thought it was wack that the Heat retired Jordan's number. Nah, leave that to their own franchise. The Lakers have retired his number, and I think we should let that be. Let other teams and players honor him by wearing the same number as well. Also, you never know why other players may be wearing a certain number, it would suck if a player had to change numbers when for example they initially wore that number to honor their father or something."
"2016Winner","69","Tue Jan 28 20:30:47 2020 UTC","It’s just uncharted territory, as the only greats to die before Kobe have been Moses Malone, Wilt, Maravich, Hondo, Petrovic, and maybe a few others. It is probably unlikely that any players have picked a jersey number to posthumously honor any of those players, and in any case there is nobody like Kobe that is deceased and inspired so many people."
"FlameOfWar","518","Tue Jan 28 19:31:51 2020 UTC","I think it's more respectful wearing his number than not"
"Expulsure","354","Tue Jan 28 19:41:16 2020 UTC","Everyone’s got their own opinion. Everyone will choose to respect him in their own way"
"Expulsure","66","Tue Jan 28 19:22:55 2020 UTC","I know this is hitting Dinwiddie hard, I hope he’s alright. Respect him even more for this"
