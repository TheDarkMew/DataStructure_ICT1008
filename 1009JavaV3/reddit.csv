"MrBrazen","scores for stickied comments are visible to mods only","Sun Jan 26 20:58:10 2020 UTC","Given his relation to CSGO and the plethora of rumors surrounding this crash on Twitter and in the media, it should be noted that the rumors alleging that Rick Fox was also aboard the helicopter are reported to be false by his daughter and multiple other sources. Please do not spread this rumor as it detracts from the focus of this tragedy. Unfortunately, however, TMZ does report that his daughter Gianna Bryant was with Kobe in the helicopter and died alongside her father in the crash."
"MidnightDeathNoodle","1868","Sun Jan 26 20:24:51 2020 UTC","Wow had no idea he passed today. Rip Kobe. Man was a legend."
"RJLPDash","845","Sun Jan 26 20:26:27 2020 UTC","Yeah, it wasn't the most pleasant way to go either, apparently his kids may have died with him but everything is still unconfirmed Either way it's sad Edit: Apparently it's confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was with him on the helicopter, Rest in Peace to them both, that shit is so sad"
"Crazyleprechaun87","232","Sun Jan 26 20:30:42 2020 UTC","From what ive seen on twitter its been confirmed one of his daughters was on the helicopter and Rick fox has also been confirmed to have not been involved in the crash. really wish people wouldnt just say shit on twitter / shitty online news articles for clicks."

EDIT: TMZ: 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376 Sources: Kobe Bryant was on his way to a travel basketball game with his daughter Gianna when the helicopter crashed. Those aboard the helicopter also included another player and parent."

Edit: There are people saying that his daughters were with him and there are people also saying that Rick Fox was with him so there is a lot of misinformation being spreaded now. As of now, the only person we absolutely know was on the plane Helicopter was Kobe so it's better to wait for some confirmation on the other people on the plane. Edit #2: 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks. Edit #3: Multiple sources are saying that Rick Fox is safe and well the information spread about him being in the helicopter is not true. Edit #4: There were 9 people on the plane including Kobe and his daughter Gianna. Three of them have been identified as Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife and his daughter"

"SICKO-Doumbouya","1005","Sun Feb 16 01:06:22 2020 UTC","I feel like Silver’s job is so easy. He plays us so well, gives us off-court things we want while adding on-court shit we hate."
"Mister100Percent","644","Sun Feb 16 01:12:07 2020 UTC","Tbh that China thing was a nasty situation."
"Hisoka_Brando","368","Sun Feb 16 01:29:04 2020 UTC","It was essentially a no win situation for him, he either follows his morals and costs his league and players millions, or he ruins the reputation of the league. Edit: to be clear, I am saying from the perspective of Adam silver it’s a no win situation. If he says no to China, his league loses millions in revenue and even more in potential profit. I’m not saying he was right to ignore morals and ethics, I’m just saying he can’t follow his morals without jeopardizing what’s more important to him which is money. And by doing that he messed up his leagues reputation of being “Woke” and “Socially conscious”."
"snowcone_wars","752","Sun Feb 16 01:43:36 2020 UTC","No win situation Have morals Don't have morals Standing for what is right is hard. It has consequences, and costs. But that doesn't mean it should ever be considered a loss. Standing up for the oppressed is always a win, and anything you lose in the process should be worth it. Unfortunately, people don't really think that way much anymore. Edit: Ok, this has gotten a couple of golds now, so I just want to say to anyone else thinking of gilding it: please don't. On a post about how morally and ethically repugnant China is, giving money to this site when it's backed by a number of Chinese investment companies (Tencent notably) strikes me as wrong. If you really are desperate to throw 5 bucks away, please just consider donating it to a charity of your choice. Or, there are still a number of Honk Kong crowdfuning operations going on to help support those who have been injured during the protests, or their families if they have been killed. Or, just be a good person. Speak up when you see injustice. We could all stand to be better people who take more action in our day-to-day lives."
"Hisoka_Brando","168","Sun Feb 16 01:46:00 2020 UTC","What sucks is the nba is a business, even if he wanted to say no to China all of his financial backers, partners and nba players would protest him for costing them millions."

"SnuggleMuffin42","29","Sun Feb 16 02:14:10 2020 UTC","It's an American business. At least some of its values should be informed by the values of the American people. Things like freedom, liberty, justice... To just exclaim ""Well, it's a business"" doesn't absolve the businessman of moral responsibility. This bestial capitalism where every mean is justified by the bottom line end is something we can reject. We aren't slave to capital, and neither are the billionaires owning the NBA. They have a choice."

"Hisoka_Brando","27","Sun Feb 16 01:49:35 2020 UTC","Even if he believed that, there is no way any of his investors and partners would allow it. Heck, we saw Lebron Mr Woke himself bend over backwards to not lose the China money."
"Vindicare605","9","Sun Feb 16 02:00:37 2020 UTC","He wouldn't just be losing money for himself though that's the thing. If it was possible for him to bear the full burden of standing up to China I'm sure he would, but the NBA is massive and pissing China off hurts all the way down the line. That's what makes it a no win situation. I agree with everything else you said though."
"Jswarez","28","Sun Feb 16 01:44:34 2020 UTC","Plus the average person says they care . But don't. We are all on Reddit, who is owned by ten cent and backs the china censorship thing. We don't quit Reddit."

LA times twitter is telling people they are doing their best for independent confirmation. Edit3: International media is picking up on it, some pretty big publications like ""Daily Mail"".

When he got older the fan became blind, missed a couple games and said fuck it, I am going back to the games because although I cannot see it, I can at least hear and feel the atmosphere of the fans. This year is also the 100th year of the clubs existence but sadly the fan passed away. The club built a statue of the fan and he remains there all season.

"ItsGettinBreesy","117","Sat Feb 15 18:08:56 2020 UTC","It’s so crazy to think about the transformation of Kobe over the years. He went from the villain to the hero, from disliking players to being a heavy proponent of the growth in the WNBA and training players. It goes to show you how age and maturity can give you humility"
"captainhukk","10","Sat Feb 15 19:23:31 2020 UTC","A-Rod had a similar transformation in baseball. Albeit, I think Kobe's impact was much greater (especially since the NBA is a more interconnected community and affects those who use social media way more due to demographics). However, the public image perception change of both Kobe and A-rod is very similar imo. A-Rod went from being hated to beloved"
"SR3116","33","Sat Feb 15 20:09:42 2020 UTC","I really don't think is a very good comparison at all. Kobe was the villain because of his relentlessness and talent. He'd cut your heart out and was willing to sacrifice his own body to do it. A-Rod was a villain because he was a cheater and very smug about the whole thing. Also, Kobe was incredibly knowledgeable about the game of basketball and very insightful and eloquent when discussing it. A-Rod is widely considered by most baseball fans to be an unbelievably terrible announcer and is constantly meme'd for it. Thinking on it, I honestly can't come up with a solid baseball comparison for Kobe. All the generational icons of the sport are either actually assholes instead of genuinely just competitive (Bonds, A-Rod) or incredibly nice off the field (Griffey Jr, Pujols). Kobe was one of a kind."
"Bruster10","26","Sat Feb 15 20:38:59 2020 UTC","Kobe was a villain in large part because of the sexual allegations against him in early 2000s. Not saying there wasn’t some hate there because of his talent level, but to chalk up all the negative perception he had against him early in his career to “talent and relentlessness” is 100% rewriting history"
"captainhukk","15","Sat Feb 15 20:16:27 2020 UTC","He may be a bad announcer, but if you listen to A-rod break down baseball, he's insanely knowledgeable about it, and clearly has a deep love for it just like Kobe does. A-Rod was also hated due to his arrogance and how successful he was, plus being combatative with his teammates. Idk if you remember, but when he joined the Yankees and got into fights with Jeter, it was a pretty big deal. I'm not saying they're exactly the same, but they are very similar in their overall changed perceptions. A-Rod is pretty beloved publicly now, when he was hated even as little as 5-7 years ago."

"HippiesBeGoneInc","11","Mon Jan 27 22:45:34 2020 UTC","""Yeah he scored 60 but look at the amount of shots he took!"""
"pragmaticlysarcastic","293","Tue Jan 28 00:12:02 2020 UTC","Yeah 60 points on 50 shots is . . . not actually bad. He posted .543 TS and .500 EFG. Especially when you consider he was 16 for 29 from 2 and it was mostly chucking 3s when he was gassed!"
"jyok33","78","Mon Jan 27 20:24:04 2020 UTC","Kobe would probably want it like that"

"jawlrule","471","Tue Jan 28 04:19:53 2020 UTC","I hated Kobe growing up cause of the rivalry. Grew to respect him of course as all time great and rooted for him when his final game originally happened. Watching this game tonight I've cried several times and can't seem to completely stop. I'm glad we have all been able to come together through this tragedy."
"UniqueAssUsername","132","Tue Jan 28 07:23:04 2020 UTC","Same here brother. My favorite player growing up was AI, so ever since 2001 I couldn’t stand him. He was just TOO good! Lol. Kobe was like the final boss for so many teams/fans, which is why people “hated” him. But underneath that “hate” was profound respect and admiration. I’m just glad, as I matured, I was able to appreciate his greatness."
"suzukigun4life","118","Tue Jan 28 04:27:50 2020 UTC","I've never been on a game thread on this sub for even a quarter, much less a game before tonight. Being on that thread for two hours, reading others venting, while also seeing people treat the game as if it was happening in real time was therapeutic."
"IraqouisWarGod","599","Tue Jan 28 05:20:48 2020 UTC","My 9 y.o. daughter didn’t really know Kobe before yesterday but she’s been really taken in over the past 30 hours and it’s led to to really deep convos. We’ve talked about heaven, infidelity, parenting, God’s sovereignty, basketball, coincidences, hard work, role models, helicopter safety, and so much more. I wasn’t the biggest fan of his, but I watch her watch him I can see she is just getting sucked in. I’m not sure she wouldn’t say he’s her favorite player. The toughest part was tonight as I let her watch the first quarter on ESPN. She’s getting so bummed as he starts 0/5. When he got hot and cashed that ridiculous near the end of the quarter she was so happy and then she looked up at me and said: “Daddy are you sure he’s dead?” “Yeah, baby. He’s gone” “Dad are you absolutely sure they just haven’t found them yet? Is there any way he’s still alive...”"
"TEFL_job_seeker","268","Tue Jan 28 06:43:54 2020 UTC","I hate when kids realize life is short. I mean, it's good for them to realize it, everyone has to, but death just stinks."
"UncatchableCreatures","123","Tue Jan 28 07:57:05 2020 UTC","Had a childhood friend in 4th grade drop dead on the playground because her heart stopped working. I don't think I've quite gotten over it at 30. I don't know why I'm typing this to you stranger. Death sucks man I'm crying now :("
"steelanimal","108","Tue Jan 28 06:56:31 2020 UTC","My brother is 10 and called me at school crying. He’s just starting to get into sports and understand death and was devastated. I remember playing 2k10 when I was his age with Kobe on the cover. Saying “Kobe” every time I threw something out at school. Thinking about his legendary work ethic when I didn’t want to work out in high school. Seeing the impact he had on a 10 year old in Cleveland who doesn’t even remember him playing makes you realize how much his death resonates"
"Whiterabbit--","64","Tue Jan 28 06:29:07 2020 UTC","those are deep conversations. I'm not ready for my daughter to turn 9."
"Number333","7217","Tue Jan 28 03:56:56 2020 UTC","Even re-watching the game seeing the Lakers down 86-96 with a little over 2 minutes left - it's absolutely insane how storybook that ending was. Saddest part of me was seeing Gigi go nuts after Kobe pulled up from 3 to make it a 95-96 ballgame. Goddamn."

"WhoStoleMyBicycle","62","Wed Jan 29 23:46:07 2020 UTC","This is the only reason I don’t totally hate the fact he was here.

"8976r7","4412","Sun Jan 26 20:59:01 2020 UTC","It just got so much worse. They're now reporting his 13 year old daughter was on board. They were on their way to Kobe's basketball academy in Thousand Oaks for a practice. edit: even worse, there was also a kid from the team on board with their parent. so 2 children died in the crash. edit: now 9 people were on board. edit: it gets worse. Three of the passengers were a mom, dad and their 13 year old daughter. Their other daughter was not on board, but that means she lost her whole family today."

"iknowCatMan","51","Sun Jan 26 23:49:47 2020 UTC","Exactly. At least the family doesn't have to move and further disrupt things for the kids just because they can't afford the lifestyle without Kobe."
"jakethesnake55","112","Sun Jan 26 22:38:02 2020 UTC","That’s a slippery slope though. You learn what a great man he was through all the recorded media on hand, but never had a chance to say hello."
"LePhilosophicalPanda","236","Sun Jan 26 22:42:03 2020 UTC","That's not what a slippery slope is, but I agree with you. It must be incredibly sad, although at least his daughter can be proud of the man her dad was"
"Metal_Charizard","81","Sun Jan 26 22:51:36 2020 UTC","Double-edged sword?"
"LeQiz","37","Sun Jan 26 23:00:07 2020 UTC","Think about it though. Think about a child from a normal family that loses their father before they have a chance to remember meeting him. Their only way to know that person is through photos, maybe some home videos, and the testaments if people that knew him when he was alive. His daughter will have a better idea of her father then most that lose theirs do. Hundreds of hours of interviews, and a huge community of his peers that will guide and support her as she grows up. This is an absolutely horrible tragedy, but she's luckier than most in her position. She'll have a hundred father figures as she grows into a woman."
"ygduf","61","Mon Jan 27 00:06:12 2020 UTC","Honestly that daughter is both then luckiest and simultaneously the unluckiest (outside of Gigi). Won’t know the pain of losing him, but never will have gotten to know him either..."
"zoe_xo","18","Mon Jan 27 00:56:43 2020 UTC","Exactly, it's so sad , all if it, I can't even imagine the pain his wife vanessa is feeling right now ???"
"themcjizzler","179","Sun Jan 26 22:35:29 2020 UTC","They have a 7 month old newborn. She will never know her dad."
"icecubetre","184","Sun Jan 26 23:36:50 2020 UTC","She will. Everyone will tell her how he was a hero to many and she will grow up seeing videos of him and hear from all of the lives he touched. Obviously not the same, but she'll at least know and see that her dad was a beloved man and role model."
"havoc1482","27","Mon Jan 27 00:19:59 2020 UTC","I worry about her tho. Seeing how great he was but always wondering if she could live up to something like that. Him not being there to physically say shit like ""im proud of you"" is godtier sad to me"
