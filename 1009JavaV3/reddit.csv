Please do not spread this rumor as it detracts from the focus of this tragedy. Unfortunately, however, TMZ does report that his daughter Gianna Bryant was with Kobe in the helicopter and died alongside her father in the crash."
"MidnightDeathNoodle","1872","Sun Jan 26 20:24:51 2020 UTC","Wow had no idea he passed today. Rip Kobe. Man was a legend."
"RJLPDash","847","Sun Jan 26 20:26:27 2020 UTC","Yeah, it wasn't the most pleasant way to go either, apparently his kids may have died with him but everything is still unconfirmed Either way it's sad Edit: Apparently it's confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was with him on the helicopter, Rest in Peace to them both, that shit is so sad"
"Crazyleprechaun87","229","Sun Jan 26 20:30:42 2020 UTC","From what ive seen on twitter its been confirmed one of his daughters was on the helicopter and Rick fox has also been confirmed to have not been involved in the crash. really wish people wouldnt just say shit on twitter / shitty online news articles for clicks."

EDIT: TMZ: 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376 Sources: Kobe Bryant was on his way to a travel basketball game with his daughter Gianna when the helicopter crashed. Those aboard the helicopter also included another player and parent."

"Hisoka_Brando","370","Sun Feb 16 01:29:04 2020 UTC","It was essentially a no win situation for him, he either follows his morals and costs his league and players millions, or he ruins the reputation of the league. Edit: to be clear, I am saying from the perspective of Adam silver it’s a no win situation. If he says no to China, his league loses millions in revenue and even more in potential profit. I’m not saying he was right to ignore morals and ethics, I’m just saying he can’t follow his morals without jeopardizing what’s more important to him which is money. And by doing that he messed up his leagues reputation of being “Woke” and “Socially conscious”."
"snowcone_wars","755","Sun Feb 16 01:43:36 2020 UTC","No win situation Have morals Don't have morals Standing for what is right is hard. It has consequences, and costs. But that doesn't mean it should ever be considered a loss. Standing up for the oppressed is always a win, and anything you lose in the process should be worth it. Unfortunately, people don't really think that way much anymore. Edit: Ok, this has gotten a couple of golds now, so I just want to say to anyone else thinking of gilding it: please don't. On a post about how morally and ethically repugnant China is, giving money to this site when it's backed by a number of Chinese investment companies (Tencent notably) strikes me as wrong. If you really are desperate to throw 5 bucks away, please just consider donating it to a charity of your choice. Or, there are still a number of Honk Kong crowdfuning operations going on to help support those who have been injured during the protests, or their families if they have been killed. Or, just be a good person. Speak up when you see injustice. We could all stand to be better people who take more action in our day-to-day lives."
"Hisoka_Brando","165","Sun Feb 16 01:46:00 2020 UTC","What sucks is the nba is a business, even if he wanted to say no to China all of his financial backers, partners and nba players would protest him for costing them millions."

"SnuggleMuffin42","27","Sun Feb 16 02:14:10 2020 UTC","It's an American business. At least some of its values should be informed by the values of the American people. Things like freedom, liberty, justice... To just exclaim ""Well, it's a business"" doesn't absolve the businessman of moral responsibility. This bestial capitalism where every mean is justified by the bottom line end is something we can reject. We aren't slave to capital, and neither are the billionaires owning the NBA.

"jawlrule","468","Tue Jan 28 04:19:53 2020 UTC","I hated Kobe growing up cause of the rivalry. Grew to respect him of course as all time great and rooted for him when his final game originally happened. Watching this game tonight I've cried several times and can't seem to completely stop. I'm glad we have all been able to come together through this tragedy."
"UniqueAssUsername","134","Tue Jan 28 07:23:04 2020 UTC","Same here brother. My favorite player growing up was AI, so ever since 2001 I couldn’t stand him. He was just TOO good! Lol. Kobe was like the final boss for so many teams/fans, which is why people “hated” him. But underneath that “hate” was profound respect and admiration. I’m just glad, as I matured, I was able to appreciate his greatness."
"suzukigun4life","117","Tue Jan 28 04:27:50 2020 UTC","I've never been on a game thread on this sub for even a quarter, much less a game before tonight. Being on that thread for two hours, reading others venting, while also seeing people treat the game as if it was happening in real time was therapeutic."
"IraqouisWarGod","597","Tue Jan 28 05:20:48 2020 UTC","My 9 y.o. daughter didn’t really know Kobe before yesterday but she’s been really taken in over the past 30 hours and it’s led to to really deep convos. We’ve talked about heaven, infidelity, parenting, God’s sovereignty, basketball, coincidences, hard work, role models, helicopter safety, and so much more. I wasn’t the biggest fan of his, but I watch her watch him I can see she is just getting sucked in. I’m not sure she wouldn’t say he’s her favorite player. The toughest part was tonight as I let her watch the first quarter on ESPN. She’s getting so bummed as he starts 0/5. When he got hot and cashed that ridiculous near the end of the quarter she was so happy and then she looked up at me and said: “Daddy are you sure he’s dead?” “Yeah, baby. He’s gone” “Dad are you absolutely sure they just haven’t found them yet? Is there any way he’s still alive...”"
"TEFL_job_seeker","269","Tue Jan 28 06:43:54 2020 UTC","I hate when kids realize life is short. I mean, it's good for them to realize it, everyone has to, but death just stinks."

"WhoStoleMyBicycle","63","Wed Jan 29 23:46:07 2020 UTC","This is the only reason I don’t totally hate the fact he was here. Team building is a delicate process and everything from the last few years led to our Super Bowl run. I use that to cope with the fact Chip traded one of my all time favorite Eagles LeSean McCoy."

"8976r7","4415","Sun Jan 26 20:59:01 2020 UTC","It just got so much worse. They're now reporting his 13 year old daughter was on board. They were on their way to Kobe's basketball academy in Thousand Oaks for a practice. edit: even worse, there was also a kid from the team on board with their parent. so 2 children died in the crash. edit: now 9 people were on board. edit: it gets worse. Three of the passengers were a mom, dad and their 13 year old daughter. Their other daughter was not on board, but that means she lost her whole family today."
