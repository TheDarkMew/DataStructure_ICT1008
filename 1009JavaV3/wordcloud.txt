Given his relation to CSGO and the plethora of rumors surrounding this crash on Twitter and in the media, it should be noted that the rumors alleging that Rick Fox was also aboard the helicopter are reported to be false by his daughter and multiple other sources. Please do not spread this rumor as it detracts from the focus of this tragedy. Unfortunately, however, TMZ does report that his daughter Gianna Bryant was with Kobe in the helicopter and died alongside her father in the crash.
Wow had no idea he passed today. Rip Kobe. Man was a legend.
Yeah, it wasn't the most pleasant way to go either, apparently his kids may have died with him but everything is still unconfirmed Either way it's sad Edit: Apparently it's confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was with him on the helicopter, Rest in Peace to them both, that shit is so sad
From what ive seen on twitter its been confirmed one of his daughters was on the helicopter and Rick fox has also been confirmed to have not been involved in the crash. really wish people wouldnt just say shit on twitter / shitty online news articles for clicks.
TMZ confirmed his oldest daughter was on board. RIP. EDIT: Second oldest.
Not his oldest, he had a 17-year old. Gianna was his second daughter, she was 13.
damn
Didn't Rick Fox co-own Echo Fox or Misfits or NRG or something?
yeah echo fox because his son was super into league so he got into the esports side to connect with him
God imagine having so much money that you'd buy a gaming team to connect with your son.
Imagine being such a cool dad you'd start a esports org to connect with your son
Imagine being such a cool dad you’d not reject their differences from you and rather embrace those differences
Yeah he owned echo fox but shit went down within the org with racist investors or something. He now just plays an absolute shit ton of league because he loves the game and fills his competitive needs.
Echo fox yeah but there was a big ass scandal and a lotta bullshit
echo fox, pretty sure he's founder and CEO
It's confirmed that he's safe and well now thankfully
Thought it was confirmed Rick wasn't on as well
Yeah was not very sure of it just saw it on twitter and his son didnt confirm or deny it
Fox's daughter officially confirmed he was not on board.
Got it thanks to see ill fix my comment now
Unfortunately, this is real. EDIT: TMZ: 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376 Sources: Kobe Bryant was on his way to a travel basketball game with his daughter Gianna when the helicopter crashed. Those aboard the helicopter also included another player and parent.
No fucking way
I’ve never been in such shock over an athlete’s death, dude is an absolute icon and a legend already and is gone at such a young age
I'm in the same boat. I've never been a huge fan of basketball, but you hear these names over and over again and I have immense respect for them. My heart sunk when I saw the news.
I don't think I've even watched a full basketball game but I'm shocked and saddened, in that boat with you.
Exactly, and realizing he was only 12 years older than me. Only 12 fucking years. It's surreal, this is actually making me feel something and I never watch basketball.
I was just watching the Hoosiers game and heard breaking news. Saw Bryant's picture and my jaw dropped, only because he was at the game just the other night to congratulate James on passing him in points...
He wasn’t at the game but tweeted afterwards to congratulate James
Yeah...I went from furious to somber very quickly. Terrible news
I don't even watch Basketball. This is gut wrenching. My god
Right?! Fuck I mean, i know nothing about the sport but that dude is a legend and EVERYONE knows him... I'm shocked and really sad
To me personally, this is second to Roy Halladay, just because I'm from Toronto. But I think in the world of sports this is the biggest of my lifetime, in terms of an athlete dying either while active or soon after, in terms of how good they were.
Reminds me a little bit of Jose Fernandez death except obviously Kobe is a bigger name. Just remember seeing the news and being in utter shock
He was literally at a Lakers game like yesterday. How unreliably terrible for this to happen. Shooting while saying his name was something everyone on the playground did. What an absolute legend.
Lebron broke his all time scoring record yesterday. This is some freaky shit.
Googled Kobe and the first thing to pop up is a tweet from him congratulating Lebron 17 hours ago. Feels so surreal right now.
Yeah, for some reason people dying and having a twitter feed freaks me out. You see a post from a few hours ago like theyre still alive living life... and that's the last thing they ever post. What the hell. It's so weird and surreal and unsettling.
Every trash bin toss ever
I will be yelling "KOBE!" every time I throw some wadded up paper into the trash can for the rest of my life.
Literally just did it yesterday in front of everyone at work. Looked cool as shit. This is sad.
what the fuck. this is one of the most insane, out of left field headlines i’ve ever seen. RIP to an absolute legend
I've never felt this way about a celebrity death before. God damn
Felt the same thing about Roy Halladay. Just sick
First thing that came to mind for me too Roy was around the same age as Kobe too. Absolutely fucking heartbreaking
right about to get into the Hall
also a private aviation related accident
Halladay death was devastating but after the autopsy you can make sense of the situation. Not that it hurt any less, but this Kobe one feels different. So fucking tragic. ABC Report just did a news break during the Pro Bowl and the reporter said “It is believed to be that all four of his daughters were in the helicopter” Please not be the case
Its so weird that the death of a person I never met can affect my mood so much :/ This is just soooo depressing.
I haven't felt this way since Jose Fernandez died in that boat crash. It doesn't feel real.
Saddest I’ve ever been about a celebrity death. Gone too soon
Man..I grew up watching the rivalry of Bron and Kobe. I flew 20 hours in coach from Sydney Australia to Cleveland to watch Kobe’s last game against Bron there. I literally don’t know what to do I’m so shook. Bron just took him over for third, look at Kobe’s last Instagram post. I just don’t know right now...
Feels very doc halladay esque, just in terms of suddenness and that pit in your stomach type of thing
This is the same gut punch I felt when I heard that Halladay had died. RIP.
This just does not feel real. This is a John Lennon, Princess Di type moment wtf man RIP Kobe man fuck
Yeah this feels very weird. I'm never really the guy to get too upset about a celebrity's death tbh, but this feels very different for me.
Same bro. Kobe is a fucking childhood hero. Feels like a part of my childhood just died. Brings me back to playing 2k10 and stuff. Oh man
Micheal Jackson, Robin Williams, and now Kobe are the three that hit me the hardest
I checked this sub to see if anyone got traded and saw the original post on new when it was like 20 seconds old. I kinda just froze.
Bro I got a tmz alert and it was the only thing saying Kobe died for like 10 minutes. Then all the reports came flooding in...
The man just had another kid also
Let's try and keep the comments here civil. You don't have to like Kobe, but celebrating his death, making jokes about it, and wishing death/threatening other people still violates our rules. Users who threaten other people will be banned on sight.
I hope kids continue to say "Kobe" as they throw crumbled up pieces of paper into the trashcans.
I will never stop.
Every single day, around lunch time.
Any meal time
Any classroom
I just taught my two year old daughter to do that 3 days ago... :(
I say this literally every time I yeet throw a diaper into the trash with precision :(
Yeet for distance Kobe for accuracy
Yeet is when you just throw shit far as fuck. Kobe is when you accurately toss shit in the garbage
I was never a basketball fan and I still say it constantly. Definitely going to keep that tradition going. On a more serious note, I hope his wife and kids get the support they need from family and friends ... it's never a good day to lose your husband or father. EDIT: Hearing now that his daughter Gianna was with him. On top of the other victims as well .. just a horrible event.
I have literally never watched a game of basketball in my life and I'll be fucked if I dont shout Kobe everytime I yeet something
Hell, I say it when tossing silverware in the soak bin at work.
12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.
That’s so incredibly sad.
I can't imagine how heartbreaking it must be to lose a daughter and husband in the same accident
Worst day of his wife’s life. This is so incredibly sad
According to official sources 9 people were on board??? ?
He legit just had another daughter like 3 months ago too
And just went to LeBron yesterday Can't imagine how him and Shaq feel rn
I can't believe it dude. Kobe Bryant is dead. Fuck man. This is awful news.
I can't even believe it. This doesn't even feel possible. What the fuck.
Yeah my brain does not compute. Like everything points to it being a real story but I literally can't believe it.
I’m devastated, man. Just devastated.
I wasn't even a Lakers fan but this is just so so so so depressing. He's done so much for basketball. I feel so bad for his daughter and family in general, he was such a great dad :( Edit: Tmz just confirmed his daughter was on the helicopter as well. Fuck :(
I'm speechless wtf happened to my kobe
I’m completely shook right now. Grew up watching him.
at the gas pump and the woman next to me is balling bawling. This is awful. Edit: fixed it ya jerks lol. Fuck though.
It's what Kobe would want
Lol fuck you for making me laugh right now. Seriously though, thanks for this.
Ok, lmao at the typo, but... bawling* Balling is what Kobe did.
That's a little much... damn.
What the fuck man this has to be fake
Vanessa went private on Instagram so I think it may be true unfortunately
wtf man. This is crazy. That is so sad.
I can't even process that this is real.
i’m literally in shock
https://twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/1221514409056432128 The LA County Sheriff's department is confirming there was a helicopter crash in Calabasas and that 5 people have died but no names have been released yet so this is sounding very real. Edit: There are people saying that his daughters were with him and there are people also saying that Rick Fox was with him so there is a lot of misinformation being spreaded now. As of now, the only person we absolutely know was on the plane Helicopter was Kobe so it's better to wait for some confirmation on the other people on the plane. Edit #2: 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks. Edit #3: Multiple sources are saying that Rick Fox is safe and well the information spread about him being in the helicopter is not true. Edit #4: There were 9 people on the plane including Kobe and his daughter Gianna. Three of them have been identified as Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife and his daughter
Such a terrifying way to go, too. Shit.
Absolutely awful seeing as he's been on countless helicopter rides. One of my worst fears is to be on a plane and it just suddenly malfunctions and crashes.
Actually for once a smart person being interviewed.
Judging from the title of this post, I thought I was going to get the "totally pitted" version of this story
For the uninitiated: https://youtu.be/Y5ckCAUVOn0
WA-PAH
Reminds me of Malibu
This is still one of my all time favorite videos. Dude has to be Steve-Os secret father.
To be fair he seems like an expert in his field
[deleted]
I think he's talking about the surfer bro here who seems to be an expert in broing out
i have never surfed before and i understood exactly what he was saying. he is talking about how the progresstion of the wave crash was very good for riding. he knows what he is talking about just doesnt realize his audience.
I love how his profession shows through the testimony. He describes everything in terms of what he heard, and also in an extremely precise engineer-like way.
‘It was about...9:43am’ Knew it as soon as he said this
My husband does this all the time. "It's about 6.4 cm" I've been trying to teach him the definition of "about" for years Edit: Thank you all for the insight and for making me feel like I'm at a table at my husband's holiday work party. I would show him this thread if not for the fact that he doesn't know my Reddit name. I'm sure he would commiserate with all of you.
I do the same. The about just means it might be my measurement is not spot on. Feels arrogant to state something you might be wrong about as a a hard fact.
You've just articulated why I do this when I never could myself, thanks.
Exactly. Accuracy and precision are different. If you have a precise reading that you're not that sure you trust, 'about 6.4cm' is the perfect way to express that.
well if its only 6.4cm, he'll count every mm he can take ;)
Look he just got out of the pool, OK?
The guy said he's a sound engineer, kind of the perfect witness in an accident that nobody really could see because of the fog, but could be heard. Not only with a technical knowledge of how sound travels, but also with a trained ear for it.
Also sounds like he knows about piloting helicopters
BIG W
A nice way to honor Kobe and make sure his name will always be relevant to the nba.
Kudos to Adam Silver for this Lebron playoff mode activated tomorrow to get the first Kobe Bryant trophy
I feel like Silver’s job is so easy. He plays us so well, gives us off-court things we want while adding on-court shit we hate.
Tbh that China thing was a nasty situation.
It was essentially a no win situation for him, he either follows his morals and costs his league and players millions, or he ruins the reputation of the league. Edit: to be clear, I am saying from the perspective of Adam silver it’s a no win situation. If he says no to China, his league loses millions in revenue and even more in potential profit. I’m not saying he was right to ignore morals and ethics, I’m just saying he can’t follow his morals without jeopardizing what’s more important to him which is money. And by doing that he messed up his leagues reputation of being “Woke” and “Socially conscious”.
No win situation Have morals Don't have morals Standing for what is right is hard. It has consequences, and costs. But that doesn't mean it should ever be considered a loss. Standing up for the oppressed is always a win, and anything you lose in the process should be worth it. Unfortunately, people don't really think that way much anymore. Edit: Ok, this has gotten a couple of golds now, so I just want to say to anyone else thinking of gilding it: please don't. On a post about how morally and ethically repugnant China is, giving money to this site when it's backed by a number of Chinese investment companies (Tencent notably) strikes me as wrong. If you really are desperate to throw 5 bucks away, please just consider donating it to a charity of your choice. Or, there are still a number of Honk Kong crowdfuning operations going on to help support those who have been injured during the protests, or their families if they have been killed. Or, just be a good person. Speak up when you see injustice. We could all stand to be better people who take more action in our day-to-day lives.
What sucks is the nba is a business, even if he wanted to say no to China all of his financial backers, partners and nba players would protest him for costing them millions.
Very true, lots of nuanced implications for everyone involved.
It's an American business. At least some of its values should be informed by the values of the American people. Things like freedom, liberty, justice... To just exclaim "Well, it's a business" doesn't absolve the businessman of moral responsibility. This bestial capitalism where every mean is justified by the bottom line end is something we can reject. We aren't slave to capital, and neither are the billionaires owning the NBA. They have a choice.
CEOs have a legal (and moral) fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders/investors... This is not nearly as simple as you're making it out to be.
This is the hardest thing to understand. If we stop fighting, if we just let it continue are we better for it? The answer is no, if you lose right now it happens. The hardest thing is losing yourself.
Even if he believed that, there is no way any of his investors and partners would allow it. Heck, we saw Lebron Mr Woke himself bend over backwards to not lose the China money.
He wouldn't just be losing money for himself though that's the thing. If it was possible for him to bear the full burden of standing up to China I'm sure he would, but the NBA is massive and pissing China off hurts all the way down the line. That's what makes it a no win situation. I agree with everything else you said though.
Plus the average person says they care . But don't. We are all on Reddit, who is owned by ten cent and backs the china censorship thing. We don't quit Reddit.
Fuck him for the entire Hinkie situation. And to be honest every good thing he's done in his tenure has been obvious. Not to mention people ignore all his horrible decisions: the draft lottery reform, jersey ads, supermax failure, has not even looked into the bad reffing league wide (sides with refs and penalizes players for uttering a word criticizing them), the NBA awards timeline alteration making no sense. Honestly I think he's pretty shitty commissioner.
He's still better than the other big 4 commissioners
Lol everyone fucking hates Manfred rn
Dodgerbro checking in
Heh, you don't even have to be a Dodgers fan to hate Manfred. Fans of every team other than the Astros hate him. r/baseball is filled with Giants and Red Sox fans saying they feel like they need to take showers after siding with the Dodgers and Yankees lol.
Please report any trolls to make it easier for us to spot things; there's a lot going on in this subreddit right now. Be wary of rumors. Thank you. Edit: Treat this as a megathread please. Some posts are being removed since there's such an influx right now. Thanks for understanding. Edit 2: Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation if anyone wants to take a look/give support to their foundation.
Horrible news, but thankfully he lived his life the way most people should strive to. Life can end at any moment, and he tried his hardest in any endeavor and made himself a legend. Of course people should be sad, but don't forget what he left behind for inspiration.
Tragic. Very sad to lose a legend so early in life. Kobe Bean was making huge strides in the entertainment industry as well. I really feel for his kids. He seemed like a great father. Horrible news.
at least he got his oscar, that seemed to be what meant most to him, so glad he got to accomplish it
Man that makes it even sadder, he was so young and still had so much more to give the world
I actually disagree, he had so much more to give, but at least he got a chance to show people that, and ultimately, Kobe got to accomplish his dream of winning an oscar and giving back to the game of basketball, he had so much more to do, but the small bit he did do will without a doubt be remembered forever
My dad said the same sentiment, that he had a great life.
I’m a grown ass man crying today for a dude I’ve never met. That’s the impact Kobe had on everyone. Mamba forever
Me too man. To be fair, I probably cry more than most men. But I can't ever remember being impacted by a celebrity death like this. Closest I'd ever gotten to tears was Carrie Fisher, but I don't think that really made me cry. Part of me wants to watch Mamba highlights right now, but I just know that'll make me sadder. This sucks. Prayers for Kobe's family.
Can't find any secondary sources, but TMZ is usually legit. I really hope it's fake.
KTLA is also reporting a fatal helicopter crash in Calabasas.
I really hope this shit isnt real edit: :(
Same. I feel like I’m gonna throw up
Apparently a helicopter DID crash in Calabasas.
[deleted]
This was my first thought after seeing he was confirmed. God bless them
Woj reporter it
Dude, same and I just finished work :(
Multiple confirmations of a plane crash now. Some are also confirming likely fatalities, TMZ just happens to be the only one saying one of the fatalities was Bryant. Edit: Someone edited his wikipedia. Edit2: Some other reporters are also reporting his death, but they all seem to be refereeing the TMZ report. No additional sources. LA times twitter is telling people they are doing their best for independent confirmation. Edit3: International media is picking up on it, some pretty big publications like "Daily Mail". Journalist standards for those types of publications usually only do that if there are multiple independent confirmations. People are either going to be fired over this for falling for a scam or Kobe is dead. Edit4: Now confirmed by almost every news publication on earth. Rest in Peace. Feel bad for the kids.
Daily mail has no journalistic standards
Please Lakers build a statue of him and Gigi outside of the Staples
That’s a given
Maybe playing basketball
Her sitting on his shoulders shooting the ball.
Kobe Blocking her cause he ain't backing down to anyone
Her trying to get him to flinch and he just stands there like a statue
Man.. one of the GOAT Kobe moments
My personal favorite Kobe moment of all time The birth of ‘mamba jaw’ is up there too.
He didn’t believe in cutting people slack
still one of my favorite commercials. needed this laugh.
I was behind giving him 2, one for 8 and one for 24 but we need one celebrating him as a man. Hopefully they build this to celebrate how special the bond between Kob and Gigi was
I say instead you dedicate those two seats to them and leave them unoccupied from now on
That's too much money for the NBA to pass up imo, maybe a plaque or memorial chairs and they can charge a special premium for the Kobe seats. That sounds more like something owners would do. I'm a fan of the idea I'm just making a twisted joke about greed I mean we see players regularly get injured because the NBA refuses to move back the cameramen or court side seats to leave some space.
Lol, the Lakers can afford to put a couple seats away. NBA has no say in the first place.
They probably cant. This would be worse than the lifetime seats AA offered back in the day, Cuban infamously called it the best investment of his life.

Valencia CF, a soccer team in Spain put a statue of one of their fans in the stadium seats. The fan was a life long fan that went to every single game growing up. When he got older the fan became blind, missed a couple games and said fuck it, I am going back to the games because although I cannot see it, I can at least hear and feel the atmosphere of the fans. This year is also the 100th year of the clubs existence but sadly the fan passed away. The club built a statue of the fan and he remains there all season. HERE is the video Valencia CF made to dedicate it to the fan. Some real tear jerk stuff HERE is the picture of the stadium with the fan's statue
To be fair, he wasn't courtside and the football stadium holds more than twice as many people as the Staples Center
You’re being downvoted but you’re absolutely correct. No shot they leave two court side seats like that empty forever. However a plaque or something would be awesome.
I feel like Kobe wouldn't want to be the reason two fans couldn't see basketball live.
Those poor snakes...having to swim with a bunch of jackasses. Edit: my first awards! Thank you!
I love how he picks up the little person.
That's Wee Man, tyvm.
He renamed himself because it's 2020 to Little person Man

Yes, because this is actually animal abuse. Not really sure why so many people seem to think this is great stuff.
Because snakes aren't cute enough.

I wouldn't be surprised if some of those snakes died when hit by said jackasses.. poor things indeed.
Holy cow. That doesn’t even look humanly possible. What a great video!!!
I couldn't have said it better myself. He wasn't just my hero but so many people's hero. RIP Black Mamba
Loved how supportive Kobe was of players who came after him. A lot of former players whine about missing the old days, but Kobe always wanted the game to thrive.
So passionate about the game. All he wanted to do was share his knowledge with everyone. He was like the father of the NBA.
And I'm not even talking about as a teacher or mentor. Kobe wanted the game of basketball itself to succeed and inspire others. He pushed himself into the role of an active ambassador of the sport and a passive symbol for what can be achieved.
How much his death affected fans globally really shows how much of an ambassador to the game of basketball he was.
And not just basketball. You saw how much of an impact he had on a lot of famous athletes and other celebrities. Look at Neymar and Djokovic’s tributes for example.
I have a friend who is currently working as a teacher in a fairly small city in western China. He said when Kobe passed it was like a day of national mourning. The school he taught at held a special prayer at their assembly, and had a vigil for him in their gym. He said that the entire school attended, many people were in tears. I don’t think I know of any other American, much less American athlete, to garner that type of reaction from people in such a seemingly remote part of the world. Long Live Mamba.
Kobe is like Hercules. A figure that will turn into myth and whose name will live forever. He's honestly at that level. People will love him forever.
The All Might of Basketball
plus ultra :(
The spirit of Mamba for All lives on.
It's the Achilles parallel he seemed to be so drawn to: a glorious young figure who made such an impact in such a short period, that long after he's gone his abilities will remain remembered. And that's how Achilles wanted it. Whether Kobe truly felt that way we'll never know.
Yeah Achilles seems the better comparison, unfortunately....
Michael Jackson probably
He was worshipped. ? Haven't really accepted his death yet. I don't think I will. He's on display on this current generation of players. And its up to them to uphold the Mamba mentality. Us too. Long Live Mamba.
It’s so crazy to think about the transformation of Kobe over the years. He went from the villain to the hero, from disliking players to being a heavy proponent of the growth in the WNBA and training players. It goes to show you how age and maturity can give you humility
A-Rod had a similar transformation in baseball. Albeit, I think Kobe's impact was much greater (especially since the NBA is a more interconnected community and affects those who use social media way more due to demographics). However, the public image perception change of both Kobe and A-rod is very similar imo. A-Rod went from being hated to beloved
I really don't think is a very good comparison at all. Kobe was the villain because of his relentlessness and talent. He'd cut your heart out and was willing to sacrifice his own body to do it. A-Rod was a villain because he was a cheater and very smug about the whole thing. Also, Kobe was incredibly knowledgeable about the game of basketball and very insightful and eloquent when discussing it. A-Rod is widely considered by most baseball fans to be an unbelievably terrible announcer and is constantly meme'd for it. Thinking on it, I honestly can't come up with a solid baseball comparison for Kobe. All the generational icons of the sport are either actually assholes instead of genuinely just competitive (Bonds, A-Rod) or incredibly nice off the field (Griffey Jr, Pujols). Kobe was one of a kind.
Kobe was a villain in large part because of the sexual allegations against him in early 2000s. Not saying there wasn’t some hate there because of his talent level, but to chalk up all the negative perception he had against him early in his career to “talent and relentlessness” is 100% rewriting history
He may be a bad announcer, but if you listen to A-rod break down baseball, he's insanely knowledgeable about it, and clearly has a deep love for it just like Kobe does. A-Rod was also hated due to his arrogance and how successful he was, plus being combatative with his teammates. Idk if you remember, but when he joined the Yankees and got into fights with Jeter, it was a pretty big deal. I'm not saying they're exactly the same, but they are very similar in their overall changed perceptions. A-Rod is pretty beloved publicly now, when he was hated even as little as 5-7 years ago.
We better have a game thread
Damn that’s a great idea
Sure, I wanted to cry a lot today anyway
That’s everyday for me
in the words of kobe "you good fam?"
I am not good today, Kobe :(
I hope your day gets better ChappedAssholeLover
/r/Kindredditors
Don't know what a ditor is but we are all truly Kindred on this day.
Well, you know, uh, what they need, I guess?
Hi there, just wanna say I hope you have a great day my dude.
I’m gonna have to cry on Tuesday anyways for the Clippers and Lakers game.
Already know a comment is gonna be like: Second quarter 5:24 left and someone is gonna comment yo f the refs what they calling
"Kobe needs to stop chucking smh"
[deleted]
Something about his TS%
"Yeah he scored 60 but look at the amount of shots he took!"
Yeah 60 points on 50 shots is . . . not actually bad. He posted .543 TS and .500 EFG. Especially when you consider he was 16 for 29 from 2 and it was mostly chucking 3s when he was gassed!
Kobe would probably want it like that
CHALLENGE THAT...ohh
Goodbye mamba.
"Mamba Out" Legendfuckingdary
Friends come and go, but banners hang forever !
Forever a Legend
Thank you everyone especially fans of other teams who came and had a hella wholesome thread with us tonight. Means the world man
I hated Kobe growing up cause of the rivalry. Grew to respect him of course as all time great and rooted for him when his final game originally happened. Watching this game tonight I've cried several times and can't seem to completely stop. I'm glad we have all been able to come together through this tragedy.
Same here brother. My favorite player growing up was AI, so ever since 2001 I couldn’t stand him. He was just TOO good! Lol. Kobe was like the final boss for so many teams/fans, which is why people “hated” him. But underneath that “hate” was profound respect and admiration. I’m just glad, as I matured, I was able to appreciate his greatness.
I've never been on a game thread on this sub for even a quarter, much less a game before tonight. Being on that thread for two hours, reading others venting, while also seeing people treat the game as if it was happening in real time was therapeutic.
My 9 y.o. daughter didn’t really know Kobe before yesterday but she’s been really taken in over the past 30 hours and it’s led to to really deep convos. We’ve talked about heaven, infidelity, parenting, God’s sovereignty, basketball, coincidences, hard work, role models, helicopter safety, and so much more. I wasn’t the biggest fan of his, but I watch her watch him I can see she is just getting sucked in. I’m not sure she wouldn’t say he’s her favorite player. The toughest part was tonight as I let her watch the first quarter on ESPN. She’s getting so bummed as he starts 0/5. When he got hot and cashed that ridiculous near the end of the quarter she was so happy and then she looked up at me and said: “Daddy are you sure he’s dead?” “Yeah, baby. He’s gone” “Dad are you absolutely sure they just haven’t found them yet? Is there any way he’s still alive...”
I hate when kids realize life is short. I mean, it's good for them to realize it, everyone has to, but death just stinks.
Had a childhood friend in 4th grade drop dead on the playground because her heart stopped working. I don't think I've quite gotten over it at 30. I don't know why I'm typing this to you stranger. Death sucks man I'm crying now :(
My brother is 10 and called me at school crying. He’s just starting to get into sports and understand death and was devastated. I remember playing 2k10 when I was his age with Kobe on the cover. Saying “Kobe” every time I threw something out at school. Thinking about his legendary work ethic when I didn’t want to work out in high school. Seeing the impact he had on a 10 year old in Cleveland who doesn’t even remember him playing makes you realize how much his death resonates
those are deep conversations. I'm not ready for my daughter to turn 9.
Even re-watching the game seeing the Lakers down 86-96 with a little over 2 minutes left - it's absolutely insane how storybook that ending was. Saddest part of me was seeing Gigi go nuts after Kobe pulled up from 3 to make it a 95-96 ballgame. Goddamn.
Kobes little wink to his family at the end...
That’s the one that got me. Fuck it’s still so surreal.
https://gfycat.com/pettyshockedgallinule R.I.P
Damn dude, this hits in the feels
Rest easy Kobe and Gigi ??
Fuck man, this one finally got me.
The score will be 24-8 he means.
the play clock will be 24 seconds all game
Chip Kelly salivating
Kelly gonna honor Bryant by having his team pull 24 seconds 3 and outs over and over
Damn it was 5 years ago and it still hurts to think about
Three years ago for us bub
I think you’re feeling alright now
I think we all realize there’s a new formula for getting the number 1 seed and going to the super bowl: hire chip Kelly and then fire him
This is the only reason I don’t totally hate the fact he was here. Team building is a delicate process and everything from the last few years led to our Super Bowl run. I use that to cope with the fact Chip traded one of my all time favorite Eagles LeSean McCoy.
I got McCoy's jersey the season before. The first jersey I ever got because I figured he would be with us his whole career.... Fuck Chip Kelly.
And about two years ago, you felt pretty damn good I'll bet.
Yeah...wtf. dammit why didn't we pick up Chip before Gruden? We'd be about fuckin ready
As a UCLA fan, it still hurts
I watched a lot of UCLA this year. Their defense was one of the worst I've ever seen
My reaction as an Eagles fan
There will be no passing
XFL has entered the chat
And instead of 4 downs there will be 8.
But every play has to be a 50 yard bomb.
Jameis has entered the chat
Imma need God to reload the save. 2020 is on some other shit
It just got so much worse. They're now reporting his 13 year old daughter was on board. They were on their way to Kobe's basketball academy in Thousand Oaks for a practice. edit: even worse, there was also a kid from the team on board with their parent. so 2 children died in the crash. edit: now 9 people were on board. edit: it gets worse. Three of the passengers were a mom, dad and their 13 year old daughter. Their other daughter was not on board, but that means she lost her whole family today.
That GIf of him and his daughter gonna hit different 13 years old ,too young .. Edit: gif in question .. https://media.giphy.com/media/JQvUME2YOpTgqCKhDb/giphy.gif
I can't even imagine the hell his wife and other daughters are going through right now.
One of his daughters is 7months old ?????
It's shitty but at the very least she has a wealth of recorded moments.
And his actual wealth. Dudes left a good life and legacy behind for his family, which is more than can be said for many others.
Well, yeah. That goes without saying. They're still people, though.
...which also goes without saying.
Exactly. At least the family doesn't have to move and further disrupt things for the kids just because they can't afford the lifestyle without Kobe.
That’s a slippery slope though. You learn what a great man he was through all the recorded media on hand, but never had a chance to say hello.
That's not what a slippery slope is, but I agree with you. It must be incredibly sad, although at least his daughter can be proud of the man her dad was
Double-edged sword?
Think about it though. Think about a child from a normal family that loses their father before they have a chance to remember meeting him. Their only way to know that person is through photos, maybe some home videos, and the testaments if people that knew him when he was alive. His daughter will have a better idea of her father then most that lose theirs do. Hundreds of hours of interviews, and a huge community of his peers that will guide and support her as she grows up. This is an absolutely horrible tragedy, but she's luckier than most in her position. She'll have a hundred father figures as she grows into a woman.
Honestly that daughter is both then luckiest and simultaneously the unluckiest (outside of Gigi). Won’t know the pain of losing him, but never will have gotten to know him either...
Exactly, it's so sad , all if it, I can't even imagine the pain his wife vanessa is feeling right now ???
They have a 7 month old newborn. She will never know her dad.
She will. Everyone will tell her how he was a hero to many and she will grow up seeing videos of him and hear from all of the lives he touched. Obviously not the same, but she'll at least know and see that her dad was a beloved man and role model.
I worry about her tho. Seeing how great he was but always wondering if she could live up to something like that. Him not being there to physically say shit like "im proud of you" is godtier sad to me
This is the comment that really fucked me up

it’s crazy because TMZ reported Pop Smokes death an hour after it happened so you know that TMZ told the general public before his family could find out. same thing happened with Kobe Bryant. imagine finding out a loved one died by scrolling through twitter.
Rest in Peace ??

Magic Johnson on Kobe Bryant: "We often don’t give black men any credit when we are good fathers and so, Kobe was an EXCELLENT father, loved his wife, and we already know what he meant to us as a basketball player.”

You didn’t have to listen to Pop Smoke’s music to have empathy for a 20 year old losing their life. Same way you didn’t have to watch basketball when to be hurt over Kobe Bryant . Some of you try so hard to look cool on twitter,
