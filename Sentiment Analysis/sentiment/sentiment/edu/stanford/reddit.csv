"MrBrazen","scores for stickied comments are visible to mods only","Sun Jan 26 20:58:10 2020 UTC","Given his relation to CSGO and the plethora of rumors surrounding this crash on Twitter and in the media, it should be noted that the rumors alleging that Rick Fox was also aboard the helicopter are reported to be false by his daughter and multiple other sources. Please do not spread this rumor as it detracts from the focus of this tragedy. Unfortunately, however, TMZ does report that his daughter Gianna Bryant was with Kobe in the helicopter and died alongside her father in the crash."
"MidnightDeathNoodle","1874","Sun Jan 26 20:24:51 2020 UTC","Wow had no idea he passed today. Rip Kobe. Man was a legend."
"RJLPDash","847","Sun Jan 26 20:26:27 2020 UTC","Yeah, it wasn't the most pleasant way to go either, apparently his kids may have died with him but everything is still unconfirmed Either way it's sad Edit: Apparently it's confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was with him on the helicopter, Rest in Peace to them both, that shit is so sad"
"Crazyleprechaun87","229","Sun Jan 26 20:30:42 2020 UTC","From what ive seen on twitter its been confirmed one of his daughters was on the helicopter and Rick fox has also been confirmed to have not been involved in the crash. really wish people wouldnt just say shit on twitter / shitty online news articles for clicks."
"Vawqer","148","Sun Jan 26 20:50:52 2020 UTC","TMZ confirmed his oldest daughter was on board. RIP. EDIT: Second oldest."
"JustRecentlyI","80","Sun Jan 26 22:20:26 2020 UTC","Not his oldest, he had a 17-year old. Gianna was his second daughter, she was 13."

"Vawqer","25","Sun Jan 26 21:36:04 2020 UTC","In general, they're not reliable. On deaths and arrests and the like, they become pretty much the most reliable."
"Vanillascout","3","Mon Jan 27 01:23:15 2020 UTC","The saying is supposed to express how weak something is. A dish void of flavor to the extent where even a single grain of salt would noticeably add flavor."
"shydes528","2","Mon Jan 27 00:40:13 2020 UTC","When it comes to serious topics like death and arrests, TMZ has something like a 98% accuracy rate. They're actually the most reliable news source with stuff like that, mostly becauze they are seemingly everywhere and their network of sources is insane."
"RJLPDash","30","Sun Jan 26 20:38:04 2020 UTC","Didn't Rick Fox co-own Echo Fox or Misfits or NRG or something?"
"-Moosk-","28","Sun Jan 26 22:11:15 2020 UTC","Yeah he owned echo fox but shit went down within the org with racist investors or something. He now just plays an absolute shit ton of league because he loves the game and fills his competitive needs."
"MMPride","1","Mon Jan 27 23:55:45 2020 UTC","That's pretty damn cool that he's 50 and he still has a competitive drive and plays games."
"Crazyleprechaun87","50","Sun Jan 26 20:44:08 2020 UTC","yeah echo fox because his son was super into league so he got into the esports side to connect with him"

"RJLPDash","103","Sun Jan 26 21:51:01 2020 UTC","The positive is that Kobe never felt the loss of his daughter and Gianna never felt the loss of her father. It's the people alive that suffer. So, if you are feeling sad, distraught, devastated, don't feel afraid to talk about it. Admitting the problem can help you overcome it. I hope his family has the strength to get through this horrible accident."
"eebro","43","Sun Jan 26 21:53:23 2020 UTC","I just keep thinking about his Daughter, she had her whole life ahead of her and it's gone just like that Kobe was able to give his family everything, they had everything they could ever want or need and BAM it's all gone just like that, shit is fucking crazy"
"-Jerbear45-","15","Sun Jan 26 22:00:10 2020 UTC","That's life. You never know when your time is. That's why it's important to live your life well, every second is important and you never really know how much you got."

"Skystrike7","629","Mon Jan 27 05:38:44 2020 UTC","I just keep thinking about his Daughter, she had her whole life ahead of her and it's gone just like that The thing is, Kobe had so much ahead of him too. Like, some athletes, once they retire you can pretty much figure they'll be out of the public eye outside of sporadic public appearances, etc. In the few years since he's retired, Kobe's won a fucking Oscar. Dude had an investment fund he was working on, and a plethora of other activities and shit. Dude was keeping active, dude had so much left to accomplish, and with his work ethic I wouldn't have bet against the man."

"nah248","5","Sun Jan 26 22:59:57 2020 UTC","Yelling ""Kobe"" when shooting a basket a lot different than throwing a grenade to kill someone though. I definitely think he deserves a moment of silence and maybe we hold off and making it a joke for a bit before saying it to honor him."

"Kikk3r","36","Sun Jan 26 23:44:14 2020 UTC","Kobe was never the most athletic freak of nature out there like someone like lebron for example you saw him always at his worst vulnerable hurt and he would push through and try his best to win. You hear crazy stories about his work ethic. Just the fact he tore his Achilles and got up then walked to the free throw line made them and walked off just shows his heart and passion. He was more than basketball he showed everyone that passion and heart can help us push us so I’m rambling but how would I know he would say that dumbass because it’s mother fucking Kobe bean Bryant"
"No6655321","2","Sun Jan 26 22:08:46 2020 UTC","In all my years of CS (since the betas), I've never heard anyone ever make this reference. Until today on social media. Was this really that wide spread? How could I be in such a bubble? I've played in many regions, all versions, and have thousands of hours. It's baffling to me. To clarify, I'm not contesting that it's a thing. I'm pointing out how baffled I am at not ever having this be a part of my experience. This is the biggest shock to me. I loved basketball (played 6 days a week for all of elementry and highschool, tournaments in different parts of the country, all that), Played and still play CS since 1999. Grew up west coast. Really had no idea this was a thing."

Mamba's philosophy was for the other 4 players on his team to give him the ball and let him do the rest. His accuracy is his trademark, hence Kobe. The reason it made its way in to CSGO is because it's a universal thing to say when making a targeted shot with an object. Think paper in a trash can, etc."

"ownage99988","6","Sun Jan 26 19:58:24 2020 UTC","Just FYI this doesn't mean they're dangerous. They're incredibly safe. Unfortunately unlike planes when they fall they fall spectacularly."
"Kohpad","30","Sun Jan 26 20:15:51 2020 UTC","Helicopters can still autorotate. It has more to do with how they're used. They fly at lower altitudes where collisions with power lines and such are more likely, and Most crashes are during takeoff and landing, which gives helicopters a much higher rate of crashes per flight hour because they make so many short flights."
"bradland","59","Sun Jan 26 22:01:05 2020 UTC","You can’t autorotate if your main rotor blades have 0 pitch or your tail rotor fails. Autorotation only works if you lose power but keep your rotor pitch"
"TheVoiceOfHam","9","Sun Jan 26 20:02:14 2020 UTC","This, planes have a chance to glide and most larger airliners can do everything on one engine. Helicopters become bricks when power is lost. Edit: Check people who know more than I below."
"bradland","6","Sun Jan 26 20:09:32 2020 UTC","This is tragic, so I feel a bit weird correcting someone, but autorotation is the helicopter equivalent of gliding. Just like a plane though, if the failure is significant enough, there can be no chance of recovery."
"TheVoiceOfHam","4","Sun Jan 26 20:33:25 2020 UTC","Autorotation is not nearly as reliable as gliding. I wouldnt trust it, and I'm a PPL. Edit: I'll add it's because while gliding is simply airspeed maintenance at best glide, autorotation requires a lot of skill to do. More than what I'd be willing to trust myself to be able to do."
"Tephlon","8","Sun Jan 26 21:15:45 2020 UTC","No offense, but I’ve spent a lot of time around pilots (I worked for a manufacturer), and y’all tend to be very “cliquey”. Fixed-wing guys can’t understand why anyone would want to fly rotary-wing, and vice versa. Also, PPL doesn’t mean you know anything at all about rotary-wing. Helicopters have different glide ratios and dead-stick flight characteristics just like airplanes. Some autorotate easily, while others require optimal conditions. Think of it this way, would you rather be caught dead-stick in a Piper Cub, or a Super King Air 350? The same kinds of disparity exist in helicopters. Most civil aviation helicopters autorotate easily because customers demand it. No one wants to fly their executives around in a brick."
"phi186","3","Sun Jan 26 21:45:21 2020 UTC","No believe me I agree with you. I was just saying that even though I'm willing to fly in fixed wing I'm not willing to fly rotary aircraft. Like you said, it's a common sentiment. (I'll admit I didnt realize it went both ways, as most non military guys I know learned in fixed initially then went to helicopters). I'm a PPL... I'm not super pilot over here. I'm just saying that even as a low hour guy the physics of it make me uneasy."
"Southportdc","13","Sun Jan 26 20:10:49 2020 UTC","Not unless they actually lose their rotors. They go down a lot harder than intended, but they can “glide” by autorotating the rotors."
"Blackdragon1221","6","Sun Jan 26 21:20:12 2020 UTC","They don't really even go down that hard. Yes the descent is significantly faster than a plane gliding, but near the bottom you can ""flare"" by moving the cyclic backwards, then increasing collective to increase the pitch of the blades as you get closer to the ground. Autorotational landings can be very smooth if you maintain enough rotor RPM and don't decelerate or raise collective too early (or too late)."
"haluwasa","14","Sun Jan 26 20:12:37 2020 UTC","This isn't totally true. The air resistance from a falling helicopter turns the rotor and creates enough lift to be vaguely controlled by a competent pilot (and it is normally a part of the training)."

Emergency personnel responded, but nobody on board survived. 5 people are confirmed dead. We're told Vanessa Bryant was not among those on board. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Kobe has famously used a helicopter to travel for years -- dating back to when he played for the Lakers. He was known for commuting from Newport Beach, CA to the STAPLES Center in DTLA in his Sikorsky S-76 chopper. KB is survived by his wife Vanessa, and their four daughters -- Gianna, Natalia and Bianca and their newborn Capri."

And watching the next game vs the Mets was horrific. The teammates were in such incredible pain. Bartolo Colon purposely let Dee Gordon hit a leadoff homer. He hadn’t hit a homer all year and he hit it into the upper deck. He sobbed as he went around the bases and collapsed into his teammates’ arms in the dugout. I’ll never forget it. None of that diminishes Kobe’s greatness or the magnitude of this loss. We all have our most poignant experiences."

But it was real, Kobe's gone. I wasn't sad for the first couple of hours, I was SHOCKED. Like, it wasn't supposed to happen to him. Like you said, other celebrity deaths were sad, but not shocking. Some of them died because of sickness, sad but kinda expected. Some of them died through suicide, sad but not shocking because there's a lot of news saying their life is messed up or something like that. But Kobe? It's so unexpected. Im sad now, but earlier when I woke up I wasnt sad, I was disoriented and confused because my brain couldn't process the thought that I woke up in a world without Kobe.

"kevohreal","556","Mon Jan 27 03:23:30 2020 UTC","It's terribly sad. I was at that game with my brother (Dec 29 v. Mavericks) when Kobe and Gianna were courtside. The Lakers IG account posted a picture of him on the floor wearing a bright orange jacket, so we looked for him and sure enough there he was. It was a nice surprise now turned into a somber memory, considering that game was also my Christmas gift to my brother who's been a die-hard fan for over 20 years. Those tickets ended up being the last time we would get to see him (and his daughter) alive. RIP : ("

In the moment I knew we were going to collide, I vividly remember taking inventory; I knew my children were in the back, buckled safely and would probably be okay but that I might not be. The feeling of “oh my god please don’t let this be the end” is like no other feeling in the world but it’s there and it is recognizable and it is vivid. If I had died though, I’d imagine my last moment would have been the floating, dreamlike sort of feeling that came between going out and coming to."

"TeslasAndComicbooks","133","Sun Jan 26 21:56:28 2020 UTC","This basically happened in my backyard. As a pilot myself, visibility was incredibly low and it looks like they flew into a mountain under IFR. Edit: listened to the ATC recording and after reading more about the flight, this pilot was trying to fly VFR under really low ceiling in a low mountainous region. The clip I listened to was a transition from Burbank class C airspace to Van Nuys class D (my home airport). Van Nuys cleared the pilot to follow the 101 freeway, which is just south of the field, towards Camarillo. Presumably, the pilot was too low to receive traffic alerts and instruction from the SoCal radar center and that was the last he was heard of. Convinced this pilot tried to squeeze between the mountain and the low cloud layer. The helicopter they were in is multi engine and has an incredibly low mechanical failure rate. I’m not going to blame the pilot without details but most aviation accidents are due to pilot error and the way this is developing is making me think that’s the case here.

"jaja_pirate","7978","Sun Jan 26 22:41:03 2020 UTC","During the live press conference, the sheriff said that they believe there were 9 people on board, a pilot and 8 passengers. He also called out TMZ for being wildly inappropriate and said “imagine finding out a loved one has died through social media”, he has requested that people stop speculating who was on board and to keep their loved ones in mind. Edit: I watched the rest, this time the man that spoke before the sheriff came back (man with a grey streak in his hair, dark green shirt and dark skin): they don’t know anything for sure yet. They received the report 9:47 AM, arrived 8 minutes later and due to magnesium, the fire took one hour to extinguish. The coroner is on site with a team and they’re working hard to get answers. They don’t know what happened, they don’t know where the helicopter took off, they don’t know for sure where it was going (these three questions kept being asked). It will take some time to identify everyone and to notify the next of kin, he once again stressed for people to stop speculating and to keep loved ones on mind. The area that they are investigating is “about an acre”, that’s also where they expect most debris to be at and where bushes were on fire. Honestly, it was him constantly repeating that they don’t know what happened yet since the press kept asking the same questions. They also kept pestering him about “taking an hour to extinguish” - but again, that’s because of the magnesium. After that they called for a spokesperson that can speak Spanish and I turned it off. Good news article here that has a better summary of the conference and updates."

We plummeted 20,000 feet before they got power back up, and then spent another 15 minutes at 10,000 feet with the most insane turbulence I’ve ever felt trying to make it to another airport for an emergency landing. During that time when everything was dark and we were just falling, I was filled with intense fear and so many other emotions. Outside of the extreme fear and anxiety I was feeling, the only other thing going through my head was how can I say goodbye to my family. I was frantically trying to turn my phone on in hopes of writing a goodbye letter in my notepad and text messages in hopes that they would at least find it in the wreckage if we crashed. It’s been over ten years now since it happened and I still get extreme anxiety anytime I’m flying and we start to descend in altitude. The first few years flying after that I needed to take large amounts of Xanax to even get on a plane. Every time I read about a crash like this it brings back so much anxiety."

You can tell how much he loves talking about his career and the competition as well as his kids and being a parent. It sounds like a corny way to talk about someone after they died but I just watched that episode last night and it was the first time I really was able to see him talk at length about his career and life in general. He was an incredibly smart guy."
"KlaysToaster","1833","Sun Jan 26 20:22:17 2020 UTC","Kobe was always cut from a different cloth than most professional athletes. You can tell by the way he talks, the way he respects the game, and the pure approach he gives to the game, that he's just on another level. He inspired so many current athletes, and has personally meant a lot to me growing up as a young basketball fan. This is incredibly devastating, but Kobe Bryant can finally rest now knowing he maximized his time on this earth, and should have no regrets."

It was honor to watch you Black Mamba, from the first time you entered the game that I saw live on serbian 3K channel back in 1996, the times you took down our Peja and Vlade in 2002, and all the way up to this moment when you were a living legend of the Basketball sport.

"DTX41","102","Sun Jan 26 22:12:08 2020 UTC","Kobe was only four years older than me, but when he came to Cleveland for a game against the Cavs in 2001(ish) some of my friends and I bought tickets to see him and Shaq destroy our home team. The Cavs were bad in 2001 so tickets were cheap and we ended up sneaking down to the lower bowl and sitting 10-15 rows behind the Lakers bench. As expected, the Lakers were beating the Cavs soundly and Kobe came out for a rest in the 4th. The arena was pretty silent by this point and most people had already left, so when the three of us started a “KOOO-BE KOOO-BE KOOO-BE” chant he turned around in his seat and pointed at the three of us and shot us that devilish grin. My buddy yelled “COME TO CLEVELAND!” and he laughed and shook his head no, then gave us another ridiculously smooth grin and turned back around. Maybe 10 seconds of his day at the end of a game that was already over that he probably doesn’t remember, but man it made our night. The Kobe chant is still an inside joke between us some 20 years later. Kobe was great, and I’m not gonna try to rank how great but he was undeniably great. Once-in-a-decade talent, like Oscar and Wilt and Kareem and Magic and Bird and MJ and Bron and KD and Antetek... Giannis. Only the best basketball players make the NBA. Only the best NBA players are decade-long starters. Only the best of those are legends. Kobe was a legend, even before he passed."

"invincibleblackadam","101","Sun Jan 26 21:15:07 2020 UTC","May 23, 2010. The Suns had just won game 3 of the WCF against LA, 118-109. Kobe had 36, but went 2-8 from beyond the arc, missing his only two attempts in the 4th when the game was close. Game ended at 11 pm, and I had a few things to finish up before heading home. The way the arena was set up, the fastest route to the parking garage was to walk through the main bowl after leaving the office. As I make my way out at 11:30 pm, the lights in the arena dim, I hear a ball bouncing on the main court. I look to see who it was, and found Kobe out there shooting 3s. By himself. Top of the key, shoot, make it, get the ball. Back to the top of the key, shoot, miss, get the rebound. No coaches, no trainers, no teammates. Just the best player on earth, practicing his 3 point shot, alone. I sat down about 20 rows up, in an otherwise empty 18,000 seat arena, and watched one of the best five humans to ever play the sport practice in solitude for 25 minutes. After he had put up probably 75 or 80 threes from all around the arc, he grabbed the ball and went to the locker rooms. That night taught me so much about what it meant to be THE. BEST. About putting in work that no one sees. About perseverance. About never being happy with how good you are and always wanting to improve, even if you’re already the best. Kobe made a lifelong fan in those 25 minutes. RIP to one of the all time greats."
"AceAndOne","94","Sun Jan 26 21:27:02 2020 UTC","That's a fantastic story. I always despised his Lakers, but his work ethic was undeniable. His refusal to let a game go is what always impressed me the most. I can't for the life of me remember what game it was, but it was a playoff game and the Lakers were down 11 with about 2:00 on the clock in the 4th. Out of the 10 guys on the court, he was the only one who was playing like he thought the Lakers were going to win. I remember thinking it out loud and then whoever was calling the game saying something to that effect. His will alone brought it to a 3 point game. The Lakers lost, just like in your story, but seeing somebody KNOW that they're going to win a game that everyone else had abandoned was amazing. He was a greatly skilled player, obviously, but I really believe his will was his most important characteristic."
"MySilverBurrito","92","Mon Jan 27 07:08:03 2020 UTC","Some people are like ""oh its a celebrity you don't even know the person"" but people underestimate how these people touch lives. I was a kid with cancer during the '01 playoff run. I had a make a wish foundation wish to let you know how bad I was. I wanted to meet Shaq and Kobe. It's late May early June so yeah that's not happening so I settle for a PS2 a bunch of tech stuff and a big screen tv (I couldn't travel because my immune system was shot and I was afraid to ask for too big of a TV to tell you how innocent I was). Well....two weeks later I get a call. Who but Bean, calling me telling me he heard I wanted to meet him and how he was out there playing for kids like me and how he appreciated having me as a fan and to hang in there and I can overcome anything ect. It was only a 4-5 minute call but it lifted my spirits. I never told any of my friends about it, only my parents eve knew about it. I'm not saying it saved my life, but it gave me hope.... I had a ~20% chance for survival. That was 20 years ago. That man influenced the way I look at and attack life. I woke up this evening to the news of his passing and I've been crying on and off the entire time here at work trying to reason with myself ""hey this is just a basketball player why the fuck are you crying man get over it"" But I felt like a member of my own family passed.

The man was a human, which was/is easy to forget when you've looked up to him as something bigger than life for over a decade. I can't handle/process the idea of Mamba Kobe going down at the moment.

I had family on the Air France 447 flight that went down in between Brazil and France. The pilot’s instruments froze and he pulled up, taking the plane into a very slow, apparently almost unnoticeable stall. Over the years I have spoken with many flight engineers who said my sister would probably have had no idea what was happening and didn’t feel anything when she went. I always pray that was true."

None of the passengers knew anything was about to happen because the plane was in a stall, not a dive, and it was instantaneous.

TMZ Sports has confirmed. Kobe was traveling with at least 3 other people in his private helicopter when it went down. A fire broke out. Emergency personnel responded, but nobody on board survived. 5 people are confirmed dead. We're told Vanessa Bryant was not among those on board. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Kobe has famously used a helicopter to travel for years -- dating back to when he played for the Lakers. He was known for commuting from Newport Beach, CA to the STAPLES Center in DTLA in his Sikorsky S-76 chopper. KB is survived by his wife Vanessa, and their four daughters -- Gianna, Natalia and Bianca and their newborn Capri. Kobe has recently been spotted out at NBA games with his daughter Gianna -- a rising star basketball player herself. Their youngest daughter, Capri, was just born in June 2019. Story developing ... Edit: LA Time article https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas A helicopter crashed and burst into flames Sunday morning amid foggy conditions in the hills above Calabasas, with multiple fatalities reported. The crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road, south of Agoura Road, according to a watch commander for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The crash ignited a brush fire and made it difficult for firefighters and emergency personnel to get to the aircraft, he said. Sources at the scene said they believed there were multiple fatalities, but the exact number was unclear. The fire was contained to the crash site, officials said. There were no homes in the area, and no roadways were impacted. Edit: ESPN Confirms Kobe Bryant has passed away. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28569438/kobe-bryant-dead-helicopter-crash Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, 41, is among five people killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, a source confirmed to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Edit: TMZ Confirms Gianna Maria was on board the helicopter and died in the crash. 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks."

"Thehealeroftri","389","Sun Jan 26 20:32:59 2020 UTC","Not true. Helicopters are much safer then fixed wing aircraft when it comes to emergencies, if operated by a well trained pilot. As an air traffic controller, I've personally had 2 helicopters in my short career that I've been talking to declare an emergency and walk away without safe to the aircraft. This is due to a procedure called autorotation. An autorotation is a recovery maneuver where the pilot can force a short, brief rotation of the rotor causing a surge of lift. In one of my examples, a helicopter rapidly lost oil pressure and declared an emergency and aimed to set down in a field. Thanks to the autorotation, he was able to safely (but roughly) land the aircraft with no injuries. He even flew it out less then 3 hours later after preforming an oil change. Now, if that had been a fixed wing aircraft I would be discussing a tragedy. Where that pilot landed was nothing but sheer sea cliffs and dirt roads. His only option would be an attempted sea landing which often times proves fatal. Helicopter pilots practice autorotations relentlessly at my former airport, and watching autorotations was always so cool. You see the helicopter nose down and speed towards the ground only at the last second to recover and avoid the ground. I'd fly in a helicopter over an airplane any day of the week."

People don't realize how much their coordination and balance, sense of direction, and sense of motion relies on visual input. Most of the training instrument pilots receive is how to basically ignore your senses (which will lie to you) and depend solely what your instruments are telling you when you have no outside visual reference Once you loose visual contact with the ground and the horizon, your brain simply cannot calibrate it's remaining senses to know which way is up so people quite literally fly perfectly good aircraft into the ground upside down all the while thinking they are climbing or in straight and level flight.

"Elbobosan","65","Mon Jan 27 14:46:40 2020 UTC","Pilots who are not trained to fly without visual references become disoriented when they lose sight of the horizon. One would think ""why doesn't he just look as his instruments to keep his plane level?"" The problem is that if you're not expecting it your body will lose that visual reference and revert to the only other way it knows your body is level, your sense of balance. If you put an airplane into a slight bank without visual references your sense of ""level"" changes slightly if you don't use the instruments to reorient yourself. This is what happens in the video, the pilot looks at his instruments and notices he is turning slightly and corrects, but since his sense of balance thinks that slight turn was level when goes back to actual level flight his sense of balance says ""whoa hey we're leaning sideways now"". This is what kills pilots, the fight between the body telling him that he's not straight and level and his instruments saying otherwise. You start to freak out, and you're dead in less than 3 minutes."
"CookieMonsterFL","34","Mon Jan 27 15:23:25 2020 UTC","Two pilots I know have told me that learning to trust the instruments more than themselves was the most taxing part of their training. They described it as a process of breaking oneself of the most basic senses of self preservation they had. “What if the gauge is wrong?” “It’s not.” “But what if you knew it was wrong?” “It’s not.” “But what if it was?” “Then I and everyone I’m flying will die. That’s why it’s not.” The gist of the logic seemed to be situational. They didn’t always blindly trust the equipment, malfunctions do happen, and they can kill you. All else being equal, you are just far more likely to die not trusting the gauge."
"Elbobosan","14","Mon Jan 27 15:40:58 2020 UTC","i think its that sensation itself that's so hard for people to 'get' and is so dangerous. All it takes is one time to trust yourself over your instruments especially in dense fog/clouds and its all it can take."

You have to maintain speed, which is safer than driving slower than the flow of traffic, as long as your car does what it is supposed to. Ultimately the likelihood of getting into a human error related accident is way higher than the likelihood of the car dramatically failing at the critical moment. Neither is close to the whole experience. It’s the closest I’ve experienced to what was described."
"prayylmao","30","Mon Jan 27 15:57:51 2020 UTC","Here's a really good video about the physics of this phenomenon from Tom Scott. When you're in a turn, the forces of the airplane will be primarily pushing downward towards your feet, no matter how ""not-level"" the plane is, so if you can't see the horizon you could easily be tricked into thinking that you're flying level when you're really far from it."
"Tenarius","17","Mon Jan 27 16:17:48 2020 UTC","Most likely entered a spiral. Wall of text incoming. Wikipedia article link at the end for a tl;dr. The major thing is that the pilot in this video was trusting his feelings, not his instruments. This is evident right from the beginning where he notices the aircraft turning, but rolls it back to where he ""feels"" like it's level. One of the first things they teach you when learning to fly in these conditions is that your body will trick you. If you fly slightly banked for long enough or enter it slowly enough without a reference to the horizon, your inner ear will adjust and you'll believe you're straight and level. While this condition isn't fatal and is easily corrected, if left alone, before long it compounds itself, and a pilot without knowledge or experience in these conditions will rapidly find himself overwhelmed by the amount of unusual and apparently contradictory information he has to process. The correct thing to do immediately would be: trust the instrument, level the wings. You're still in low-visibility conditions, but as long as you're aware of the height of the terrain and have sufficient fuel and altitude, you can now begin to solve the problem of getting out of those conditions. But you won't crash. What happens in the video as I understand it is the pilot loses reference with the horizon because of the clouds. Eventually the plane starts banking slightly, imperceptibly to the pilot so that he gets used to the new bank and ""feels"" like he's level. But now he notices his instrument is indicating a bank, but his body is telling him he's level. He chooses to trust his body. A couple of things begin to take effect now. With the plane banked slightly, it won't produce as much lift vertically as it would otherwise, now there's an added horizontal component, so it begins to lose altitude slightly in addition to beginning a turn. As it begins to descend, the aircraft now has gravity helping it along, so it begins to gain speed. Now the pilot that trusted his body telling him seconds ago that he was flying straight and level is noticing that he's turning, the altimeter is moving, and he's gaining speed. So let's approach this logically. At this point the pilot's starting to panic, so let's solve the most pressing concern: losing altitude. If you're going down, how do you go up? Well obviously pull the nose up. If you're wings level, great. And that's what the pilot thinks. But that's not the case, we've established the aircraft is already in a descending turn. So instead of increasing altitude like he's expecting, pulling the nose up has actually pulled the aircraft further into the turn, increasing the rate of descent, speed, and rate of turn. And this is effectively where everything goes tits up, for lack of a better way of putting it. At this point the pilot is completely disoriented, all of his instruments are telling him something different and changing by the second. If he wasn't able to correctly diagnose the situation earlier when he was in a 5 degree banked turn at a 200 feet per minute descent near his cruising speed and 1500 feet above ground level, he's definitely not going to be able to solve it now in a 45 degree banked turn descending at 800 feet per minute and rapidly approaching the aircraft's never-exceed speed, blowing through 400 feet above ground level. At that point it's pretty much game over. Wiki link for graveyard spiral"

It's an information overload and the instruments you use when you can see are different than the ones you use when you can't see. If the pilot is used to referencing his standard altimeter for communication with air traffic control, he's also going to reference the standard altimeter when he panics and can't see.

In those cases you assign them special-vfr and to maintain at or below 2500 to separate them from other aircraft. You can't assign them a direct altitude because under SVFR the pilot is responsible to keep himself out of the clouds which means they may have to frequently change altitude so ATC block off those altitudes from other planes."
"skepticalDragon","125","Mon Jan 27 17:08:22 2020 UTC","The clouds were definitely worse higher up. It could have been several thousand feet before he would have gotten above it. Flying by instruments isn't just a choice to stop looking out the window and look at the instrument panel. Instrument flight is flying a specific, known course between two known points. Various directionally sensitive radios in the ship need to be set to specific frequencies and headings in order to even intersect a course line. The pilot was maintaining that he was still in VFR conditions to every controller he was speaking to when it apparently wasn't true. This pilot was very likely in violation of FAA rules concerning vfr flight and vfr conditions. If he declared an emergency or admitted that he had flown into instrument meteorological conditions he could have had his license suspended or worse. He was definitely hoping he'd get away with it. The FAA is very procedural and that's why aviation is generally very safe. He needed to declare an emergency. From there a controller could have had a chance to help. The main obstruction for a controller assist was how close he was to the ground anyway. A radar cannot always pickup small ships that close to the ground. Hilly terrain can make blind spots. If the controller could see him on radar and if the pilot declared an emergency they could have prioritized that aircraft over all others. He could have given him a direct heading to turn to and an altitude to climb to. He could have then rerouted all other conflicting traffic to other specific courses. At that point, if the emergency played out where they landed safely there would be an investigation and the pilot would likely be found in violation and get his license suspended. It could be a career ending judgment for a professional executive pilot. There's a very sad controller at John Wayne Airport that permitted that helicopter to take off when it was likely IFR conditions locally. John Wayne Airport is very near the coast and the fog is usually worse. Sometimes pilots will request a special vfr departure when there are clear conditions very near the airport. Judging from the weather yesterday morning and the evening before, just about everywhere was IFR conditions."

"keenly_disinterested","492","Mon Jan 27 14:12:56 2020 UTC","No they only adviced that because he got a special clearance through towers airspace. Special vfr, it's when you cannot maintain you're own terrain and obstruction clearance so you pass through a controlled area at or below an altitude. Once the helicopter left the second towers airspace he was on his own visual conditions. Which he said he was able to maintain. Then he went to approach but since he was so low they couldn't hear him. Within a minute or two later he crashed."
"Michelanvalo","121","Mon Jan 27 14:40:30 2020 UTC","This video depicts the flight path of the aircraft. The pilot was initially operating on a SVFR (Special VFR) clearance, which allows a pilot to operate an aircraft visually when the weather doesn't meet minimum visual requirements. Minimum VFR is 1000' ceiling with 3 miles visibility. Weather at Van Nuys was reported 1100' ceiling with 2 1/2 miles visibility. Keep in mind that ceilings are reported as altitude above the ground (AGL) while pilots report their altitude above sea level (MSL). Van Nuys field elevation in 800' MSL. The ceiling was reported at 1100' AGL, which is 1900' MSL, so if the pilot was flying at 1400' MSL he was some 500' below the ceiling. If you follow the flight path (and listen to the comms) the pilot flew along I5, orbited for a time east of Van Nuys while waiting for IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) traffic inbound to Van Nuys to land. Once all the traffic was cleared the controller handed the pilot over to Van Nuys tower. The pilot intended to fly north of Van Nuys, following the Hwy 118, then once west of Van Nuys he would turn south and pick up the 101 (Ventura Freeway) and follow it west through the canyon. Apparently he never made it to the 101 . It appears he made it to the 101, started through the canyon, and while in the canyon initiated a steep climbing turn to the left. The blip on the screen includes the aircraft's transponder data. The numbers on top are the FAA ID (N72EX), which the pilot uses as his call sign for radio comms. The numbers underneath show the aircraft's altitude and airspeed (add a zero to each number). At around 1:00, the aircraft is holding east of Van Nuys at around 1000' (which is just a couple of hundred feet in the air) but only flying 40-50 knots (around 50-60 mph). This is when he was waiting for traffic to clear. As soon as he was handed off to Van Nuys tower he accelerates to 130 knots. You can see the aircraft fly northwest, and climb to 1300' before turning west--presumably following Hwy 118--before calling Van Nuys tower. Note that the tower controller directed the pilot to tell her when he was either: a) in VFR conditions, or b) clear of her airspace. When on a SVFR clearance the controller is responsible to ensure separation between aircraft. The pilot is ALSO responsible, but the controller treats a SVFR aircraft like IFR traffic. At 3:35 the pilot asks the controller if he can turn southwest. He wants to turn that direction so he can find the Ventura Freeway, the road he will follow west through the canyon. The controller asks the pilot if he is in VFR conditions. The pilot says yes. Remember, reported weather at Van Nuys is NOT VFR, but the pilot now says he is in VFR conditions. His altitude at this point is 1700' and he's still traveling 130 knots. The pilot turns southwest to search for the Ventura Freeway. As the aircraft travels southwest it descends to 1400' and picks up speed to 140 knots. During this time the pilot is trying to get flight following radar service from SOCAL approach. Flight following is a service radar facilities provide to VFR aircraft when they aren't too busy handling IFR traffic. The controller incorporates VFR aircraft participating in flight following into the traffic flow, and warns the pilot of flight hazards (other traffic, airspace, terrain, etc.). You can hear the controller talking, but not N72EX, because the aircraft is too low for the receiver that was picking up these transmissions. The controller is telling the pilot he is flying too low to participate in flight following. The controller has a minimum vectoring altitude for each area under his control. This is the altitude below which his radar cannot maintain positive observation of aircraft. At 4:20, just seconds before radar contact is lost for good, N72EX begins a steep climb. The last reported altitude was 2100', 700' higher than the 1400' he was cruising at. Airspeed was still 120 knots. We don't know why the pilot climbed, but if you are flying in an area with high terrain and you accidentally fly into a cloud the first thing you should do is immediately climb and turn away from where you believe the high terrain is. The last few seconds of this recording does not jibe with this witnesses account, that the aircraft was flying very slowly. The last reported speed was 120 knots. If the aircraft was flying as slowly as this witness reports it would not have disintegrated on impact like it did. That looks a lot more like I would expect a 120 knot impact. EDIT: The data at this site comes from the aircraft's on-board ADS-B transmitter. You can see at the end the aircraft begins a steep climbing turn to the left while part way through the canyon the Ventura Freeway runs through. My guess is the pilot accidentally lost visual contact with the ground and tried to climb out of danger. Pilots learn (or should learn) early in training about the danger of mountain obscuration, where low clouds envelope high terrain. Attempting to fly through a canyon under such conditions can lead to a situation where the pilot is forced to climb into the clouds to avoid rising terrain."
"keenly_disinterested","35","Mon Jan 27 16:44:51 2020 UTC","The flying very slowly part can be just be their distance in relation to the helicopter. An airplane several miles above your head traveling several hundred mph might not look like it's going very fast. Might be the same effect with the helicopter."
"SumBuddyPlays","13","Mon Jan 27 17:12:37 2020 UTC","According to radar data, the aircraft was never more than 1000' above the ground. That's pretty close, especially for an aircraft that makes as much noise as a helicopter. My guess is a combination of clouds, surrounding terrain, and a tight climbing turn for the aircraft created reflections and echoes that made accurate auditory observation difficult."

The exact details will come out in the NTSB report but either the pilot was not maintaining altitude, had the altimeter set incorrectly, or simply became disoriented in instrument conditions."
"Paranoma","5408","Mon Jan 27 15:10:42 2020 UTC","simply became disoriented in instrument conditions. Flying into IFR conditions when you are VFR is one of the deadliest things you can do in an aircraft."
"DDRaptors","1041","Mon Jan 27 16:19:20 2020 UTC","No, as a helicopter pilot I can explain this. The aircraft was flying VFR, which means not on instruments. Helicopters are allowed to fly during daylight in the type of airspace he was operating in from John Wayne to the crash site in 1/2 mile visibility and clear of clouds. This is predicated on the pilot determining he is in fact flying in at least 1/2 mile visibility and clear of clouds. This is not easily done, because it can be difficult to tell whether your projected flight path will keep you out of the clouds and clouds are a kind of fuzzy looking beast in front of you, or hopefully above you, and it can be very difficult to assure you aren’t going to fly into a cloud or an area of reduced visibility up ahead. This is why you shouldn’t play with fire; just land, at an airport preferably or street, park, etc. The altitude read outs you see on these radar tracks are what the transponder reports which is Pressure Altitude, the height above the 29.92” Hg standard datum plane. This is essentially above sea level under yesterday’s conditions. So, if the altitude readout says 1,400’ you could actually be on the ground if the elevation where you are is 1,400’. What would be great is an Above Ground Level (AGL) readout, which can be determined by comparing the flight path with topographical maps. I am a pilot who flies in Los Angeles and knows SoCal very well. I know the elevations throughout most of SoCal. This pilot was flying as low as 150’ at numerous times throughout this flight. This was done to “scud run” and get through to his destination. This is unacceptable and a very dangerous practice. He had multiple chances to end the flight by landing, somewhere. He kept pushing through, into rising terrain westbound towards Calabasas. If you have bad visibility and ceilings in the San Fernando Valley you are definitely going to have a much worse time in higher terrain. It appears he flew into the clouds/fog shortly after. After realizing he was Inadvertent-Instrument Meteorological Conditions (I-IMC, or “cant see because he’s in a cloud”) he did the right thing by focusing on instruments instead, since he has no visual reference with the ground anymore. He actually began to do the right thing by climbing and starting a 180 degree turn. However, most helicopter pilots are not good at flying on instruments since we basically never do it after receiving the rating for the ability. There is a whole conversation of reasons why that is the case but is outside the scope of this comment. So the pilot likely developed Spatial Disorientation and lost control of the helicopter, which is indicated by the rapid descent in the last seconds of the flight. As a helicopter pilot this absolutely enrages me. How someone could flout company policy, standard procedures, regulations and exhibit no shred of professionalism to keep everyone onboard safe is beyond me. He could have just landed at Van Nuys and they could get a car service the rest of the way. I have done this a BUNCH of times, is a little disappointing when you can’t make it to the destination but this was some of the worst conditions we’ve seen in a long while and in the end: what are you doing risking people’s lives to please them? Just. Fucking. Land. Edit: Wow! Thanks for the gold!! Edit 2: I want to make clear in my post (as I have in responses to comments elsewhere) that this is my opinion only. My opinion based off of publicly available data, knowledge from having worked in the industry for 15 years, knowledge of the aircraft, having flown the specific type of aircraft, knowledge of the regulations regarding Part 91, Part 135, and VFR and IFR regulations, local knowledge being a pilot here, and being well-aware of the leading causes of accidents in the helicopter industry. I too am a Certified Flight Instructor and Instrument-Instructor in Helicopters. However, until the NTSB concludes their investigation and finds a cause for this accident then my opinion is only my opinion and not fact. I sincerely, and with all my heart, hope that the NTSB finds a mechanical irregularity led to this accident. Helicopter pilots are a very tight community and we are all brothers. I hope Zobayan is flying his favorite heli right now wherever he is."

"Gr33d3ater","132","Mon Jan 27 17:10:03 2020 UTC","No, it’s just very difficult to control a helicopter, or any aircraft for that matter, solely in reference to instruments. You must train and practice and remain proficient. In fact even if a pilot is Instrument Rated, the FAA requires a pilot have maintained a specific amount of proficiency within the past 6 months. If a pilot doesn’t remain proficient his rating is basically invalid and he must become current while practicing in VFR conditions only; after another 6 months of still not current it’s basically an invalid rating. So it’s difficult and you must remain current. Not-to-mention, most helicopters aren’t even certified for IFR flight, and certainly not one you would train and receive the rating in. When you do you are flying with an instructor but you are wearing foggy glasses to obscure your outside view. This means most helicopter pilots have never actually flown in clouds, even if they have the rating for it. Flying in actual clouds is very different because there are all sorts of visual illusions you will get, including vestibular illusions. You will feel as if your falling backwards, turning to the opposite side of where you are actually turning, feel as if you’re pitching up when you accelerate or the opposite when you slow. So, if a pilot pops into a cloud and doesn’t have a strong set of instrument skills and no experience actually flying in clouds then he may very likely become spatially disoriented and if he doesn’t absolutely ignore everything his body is telling him and JUST focus and trust the instruments, then he will lose control."

Without a source to update your sense of balance, it gives you wrong information. So most of your flight experience is using your sense of balance. You do some training without it, but unless you fly in cloudy weather regularly, you don’t maintain that skill.

"BorisBC","43","Mon Jan 27 22:05:34 2020 UTC","Per this article in the LA times, the helicopter pilot was Kobe's private pilot. (Kobe was well known to utilize helicopter travel. For instance, when he played on the Lakers he'd fly to the arena for practices and games.) The pilot and Kobe, presumably, go back. You'd hope that if they indeed had a long, professional relationship that there wouldn't be the power dynamic/issues. You'd think that Kobe would trust the pilot and if the pilot were to tell him they were landing, Kobe wouldn't throw a fit."
"Andiwillrun","33","Tue Jan 28 00:57:33 2020 UTC","The problem, which we will never know, is maybe they'd done these scud runs a million times before with no issues.

"ETosser","22","Tue Jan 28 01:24:13 2020 UTC","If Kobe flew as much as it sounds he did he was probably skud running all the time especially in smoggy la"

I don't think it has anything to do with pressure from Kobe. A professional pilot flying people he doesn't know will make whatever call makes him feel most comfortable. But if you're a privately paid, hotshot pilot, friend of your passenger, aware of his schedule and the needs of the day, the internal pressure to rise above circumstance and accept additional risk to pull off the job is going to be greater, IMO."
"sflage2k19","97","Mon Jan 27 22:10:08 2020 UTC","Considering they had their kids with them, I suspect they would have been very understanding if the pilot suggested landing. I guess we'll never know though."

I can almost certainly assure you that this is not the case. After a brief stint working as a concierge where we catered to some of the most powerful and famous people in the world, I cannot tell you how many times safety corners are cut because the big man in charge wants something done Right Now and there isnt time to follow procedure. I myself have been tasked with going to higher ups in other companies to beg for them to relax procedure-- you always tell yourself you wont do it, but when your boss is yelling at you, the guest is yelling at you, and you need that job in order to pay your bills, eventually most people break. I wasnt in it long enough to get jaded-- I always got nervous, tried to push back, etc. But the veterans just accepted it as a matter of course. The saddest part is that the pilot is now going to get all the blame for cutting corners, which he did, but no one will acknowledge that there was probably quite a lot of abuse and fear in that relationship as well. This is what happens when you have someone with massive power over an employee who is free to make unreasonable demands with no reprecussions-- eventually someone gets hurt."

The testing was done in the Mojave desert. After the test was finished, we headed back to LA. The weather was worse than predicted and when the pilot saw what was ahead, he immediately turned around and went back to the desert airport. There wasn't any question. He simply said ""It's not safe to fly into that"". And yes, he was a VERY experienced pilot"

You absolutely know that the pilots perception of the pressure to get his VIP passengers to their destination on time played an enormous factor in this. As soon as I saw the crash site I assumed it would be a CFIT and it is looking like that will be the case. Absolutely terrible and if that is the case the pilot is 100% to blame."
"Imagummiebear","9","Mon Jan 27 21:37:40 2020 UTC","The ol' 'Get there-itis'. We had a light aircraft go down near me here in Australia a few months ago, a father and son - because they were trying to scud run through a valley...as on the other side of the mountain was controlled airspace and they didnt want to have to go through it. Ended up in the side of the mountain. I fly light sport aircraft, and with that only VFR - I did a little bit of scud running with my very experienced instructor once to avoid some smoke in our bushfires here recently, but that was after having to change course on a navigation excercise, and it wasn't a super low ceiling but even then it was freaky knowing you couldn't go higher (horizontal visibility was 10+ though). All in all, pilots get over-confident I suppose, and think nothing can take them down when they have instruments and ATC."

"Tosirius","34","Mon Jan 27 14:18:12 2020 UTC","Being too low for flight following is a limitation of radar in mountainous terrain.

"El_Che1","22","Mon Jan 27 14:02:43 2020 UTC","1400 feet above mean sea level (AMSL) most likely. Actual altitude above ground level (AGL) will vary with terrain. ATC uses MSL, enroute weather is broadcast based on MSL, pilots have to take into account AGL when flying under visual flight rules. Also, the weather conditions at the time were ilegal for VFR flying. Which is why he was under Special VFR, which allows for reduced visibility minimums. A simple instrument flight plan under instrument flight rules would have prevented all this. I don’t know why it wasn’t used."
"QuantumBitcoin","30","Mon Jan 27 13:51:27 2020 UTC","At the point in time when they crashed they were following the 101 and it appears from the map that it veers slightly southbound prior to continuing westbound.

"Torkin","241","Mon Jan 27 14:04:46 2020 UTC","When you are living in LA the roads can get disorienting. They were following the 101 North--so if the helicopter turned at a perpendicular angle to the 101 North some people could consider it ""east"" despite it being in a southerly direction. *and as an east coast transplant, the ocean was also disorienting while living in LA. For a number of years I had to continually spin my mental map--the ocean is supposed to be to the east, not the west! And in Malibu/Calabasas where the crash took place it can be even more disorienting, as the ocean is to the south..."
"F0sh","20","Mon Jan 27 13:34:26 2020 UTC","Yes he can. But climbing up means he has to talk to ATC, tell them he messed up, get redirected to an airport, interrupt some very busy airspace, and then deal with a lot of questions. That is a big slice of humble pie to some people. What makes it even harder is his destination was RIGHT THERE, he just had s little fog in the way. The hazardous attitudes that lead exactly to this kind of situation are well known, but difficult to overcome."
"Broddit5","14","Mon Jan 27 14:24:18 2020 UTC","My worthless opinion is that it'd be surprising if the pilot straight up lied about being VFR. There's a lot of emphasis, especially for professional pilots, on being straight about this kind of thing. You'll get a very uncomfortable phone call, but flying VFR into IMC is a top cause of crashes so it's kinda stressed that it's worth fessing up!"
"Danysco","32","Mon Jan 27 16:32:03 2020 UTC","But the reason it’s stressed is because it happens. I would not be surprised if that was the case here.

"cheeseisawesome","71","Mon Jan 27 13:36:47 2020 UTC","They had a S-VFR clearance to fly. So while everyone else was flying by the instruments, they chose to fly visually. I have no idea why they were given that clearance because the visibility, even at 2500 feet, was just over 2 miles. That is horrible conditions for flying, especially in a helicopter. They ended up having to fly way under that ceiling because the airspace they went into required them to be under roughly 24-2500 feet. They ended up flying at 1400 feet or so and with the heavy fog, their visibility went completely out the window. So they were flying low and slow, and just like this man said, they flew straight into the side of the hill and didn’t even see it coming. Just overall horrible flying conditions and confusion led to this awful accident."
"ionstorm66","12","Mon Jan 27 14:09:33 2020 UTC","SVFR visibility minimums are lower for helicopters, ""CFR Part 91 does not prohibit helicopter SVFR flight when the visibility is less than 1 mile"" I regularly use SVFRs to get out of airport environments, that being said I saw the weather in LA that morning and would NEVER have taken of visually in those conditions."
"ormondo","60","Mon Jan 27 14:17:43 2020 UTC","SVFR to take off is one thing, SVFR to land is totally different. Plus knowing there is hills/mountians near by."
"USCAV19D","9","Mon Jan 27 14:56:04 2020 UTC","I’m an air traffic controller. The SVFR clearances were for the Burbank and Van Nuys surface areas only. They rely on the tower for separation in those scenarios. Once he left Van Nuys Class D he has to follow the CFR 91 flying rules and maintain VFR conditions. He’s not allowed to fly through clouds/fog like that without ATC flight following. He should not have been down at that altitude in those conditions. SOCAL didn’t want to talk to him down there because it’s a completely unsafe condition and he’s likely about 1000 ft below their MVA for that area, but I would have to check the charts. They would have needed him to climb on his own to even provide radar services. The bottom line is that the pilot should not have been flying out there in those conditions. It was likely illegal, but ultimately unsafe regardless."
"IndexCase","72","Mon Jan 27 14:31:51 2020 UTC","SFVR minimums are usually lower for a helicopter, as we can fly slower. Obviously they should have used those SVFR rules to fucking land and wait it out, or better yet just turned around and gone home."
"Alieges","15","Mon Jan 27 13:53:07 2020 UTC","This does indeed sound like pilot-error/fatigue. I am not an investigator, this is just a guess based on conditions and ATC coms. He was requesting special vfr which means that conditions are not VFR (visual flight rules) but exceptions can be made in the vicinity of the airfield. I dont know if he was instrument certified, don't know how that works on a helicopter, i can only speak to single engine piston fixed wing. But he was flying VFR in IMC (instrument meteorological conditions) conditions. METAR said OVC011 (overcast 1100 feet) and he was reporting 1400 feet. Being in IMC is very taxing if you are not used to it and he was in a 15 minute holding pattern. Being in a holding pattern without a visual horizon can mess up your balance due to your inner ear getting used to turning in a certain direction. So when you straighten out it feels like you are turning. If you are not trained for instrument flight or fatigued enough there is a chance of entering a so called graveyard spiral. A gradual undetectable (except with instruments) descending turn with subsequent flight into terrain. This is what it sounds like might have happened."
"YukonBurger","15","Mon Jan 27 14:37:12 2020 UTC","Helicopters don’t hover without pilot input. Take away a pilots sight and it doesn’t take long for the helicopter to start randomly wandering REALLY badly. You don’t feel velocity, just acceleration, so once you start wandering its harder and harder to correct. Even top notch military pilots would have a hard time staying in one place by feel without sight for more than 30 seconds. If the pilot was a normal pilot that used his eyes far more than his instruments, thick fog and thick clouds are both dangerous as fuck."
"J4rrod_","10","Mon Jan 27 14:09:44 2020 UTC","Three C's Climb Confess Communicate Most helicopter pilots are not used to flying in instrument meteorological conditions, though they may be technically rated to do so. Their requirements to fly in visual conditions are essentially a half mile of visibility and not hit clouds. Flying in clouds can be incredibly disorienting and when you fly into them inadvertently, you are not receiving any of the built-in margins for obstacle clearance provided by air traffic controllers or instrument routing or approach procedures. It is possible they were requesting help but were too low to communicate with ATC, who would have certainly climbed them to the minimum safe altitude as standard procedure."
"mackoviak","400","Mon Jan 27 15:00:33 2020 UTC","As a helicopter pilot myself, getting into clouds like that can be extremely disorienting, even to the point where you may not even know what orientation you're currently sitting at. I don't want to speculate too much, because until the results of the full investigation come out, we won't know exactly what happened. But I expect pilot disorientation to be a significant contributing factor."

Had often listened to Dornacker on the radio. In 1986, while working for WNBC 660 AM Radio in New York City (which became WFAN in 1988), Dornacker was aboard during two unrelated crashes of the helicopters leased to WNBC. She survived the first crash, but was killed in the second crash into the Hudson River, which occurred as she was delivering a live traffic report. Her death came shortly after that of her husband, Bob Knickerbocker, orphaning their 16-year-old daughter. The NTSB investigation determined the cause of the fatal crash to have been use of improper parts and poor maintenance on the part of Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, New Jersey."
"Paranoma","50","Mon Jan 27 14:18:54 2020 UTC","Oh man Right when Van Nuys Tower is handing him off he states an altitude change from 1400 to 1500. It might not mean anything, but my first thought is the pilot was struggling with VFR because of weather conditions and tried to climb a little to improve visibility. VNtower then hands him off, and they immediately lose comms with him because his altitude is too low. He was trying to improve the conditions but ended up dropping altitude instead"
"Paranoma","18","Mon Jan 27 16:03:31 2020 UTC","He was flying as low as 150’ AGL at numerous times between John Wayne and the crash site, un-fucking-believable. He was asking for an accident."

Also, Island Express, as a Part 135 operator would have needed an IFR provision in their Ops Specs, which I do not think they do. Thus, the aircraft was basically just a VFR aircraft. This was Kobe’s normal ride because Island Express has his contract, although I’m confident they would use whatever pilots were available that day, not necessarily just one pilot."

Edit: to be clear, I am saying from the perspective of Adam silver it’s a no win situation. If he says no to China, his league loses millions in revenue and even more in potential profit. I’m not saying he was right to ignore morals and ethics, I’m just saying he can’t follow his morals without jeopardizing what’s more important to him which is money.

Unfortunately, people don't really think that way much anymore. Edit: Ok, this has gotten a couple of golds now, so I just want to say to anyone else thinking of gilding it: please don't. On a post about how morally and ethically repugnant China is, giving money to this site when it's backed by a number of Chinese investment companies (Tencent notably) strikes me as wrong. If you really are desperate to throw 5 bucks away, please just consider donating it to a charity of your choice. Or, there are still a number of Honk Kong crowdfuning operations going on to help support those who have been injured during the protests, or their families if they have been killed.

Standing up to China and potentially losing millions is something that makes the principled stand also come with a cost. That's when you're tested. That's when both he and even more so, Lebron, have failed."
"sexualramen","2","Sun Feb 16 04:59:53 2020 UTC","I said this in another response, but Silver himself did in fact defend Morey. He issued one of those ""we apologize that you were so offended"" non-apologies, and he very firmly defended Morey's right to free speech -- ""The values of the NBA, these American values, we are an American business, travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression."" -- I think he made this statement when all the players were out of China. IIRC China did ask Silver to fire Morey, which he obviously didn't (and it's not like he's above firing an individual GM, look at the whole Hinkie situation). The Rockets are still censored in China, I believe CCTV isn't broadcasting NBA anymore, and the league did in fact lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, and could stand to lose billions if Tenecent pulls out of that extension."

People used to say players like Lebron could be the Kareems or Bill Russells of their generation, but now it's just insulting to compare them in any way. These guys stood up for what was right, put their careers and selves in harms way and in exchange got treated like shit by half the people in the cities they played for. Meanwhile if Lebron says something he might lose some pocket change from his hundreds of millions of dollar net worth and not only does he not say shit and doesn't defend his colleague, he actively attacks him and instead defends the shitty regime harassing him."

"bearsaysbueno","4","Sun Feb 16 04:33:36 2020 UTC","To be honest, it wasn't really as bad as people are saying. NBA's first response was basically a ""sorry you were offended"" non-apology apology. ""We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable."" Most of the criticism came from taking the word ""regrettable"" out of context, thinking that they said the tweet was regrettable, not what it actually says - that it was regrettable that people were offended. They did distance themselves from the Rocket's GM, but they did not throw him under bus either. This response was made while the NBA teams were still in China, so it's not like they could've or should've done anything more. There was some controversy about the statement in Chinese being a lot more conciliatory to Beijing than the English one, but once the teams left China, the NBA made clear that their English statement was the official one. Then Adam Silver gave a pretty forceful defense of free speech and that the NBA would not be infringing on anyone's rights, even at the cost of millions of Chinese dollars. ""The values of the NBA, these American values, we are an American business, travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression."""
"Immynimmy","64","Sun Feb 16 01:16:55 2020 UTC","Fuck him for the entire Hinkie situation. And to be honest every good thing he's done in his tenure has been obvious.

The player resting will also catch up to the NBA. There also are more & more frequent injuries. Higher pace has the consequences of requiring more strain on NBA player bodies. Plus there are too many 3s, and it isn't fun to watch. The Rockets are not enjoyable. Every year, the median number of 3's attempted goes up, the average defensive rating goes down. Nobody wants to watch 30 teams compete to see who can have the highest efficiency shooting 50 threes/game. If defense plays no role, and if refs continue to give advantage to offensive players, this is really, really boring to watch. As boring as it was when the league tilted too much in the direction of defense (the Bowen-era Spurs). Eventually they'll need to make the 3 point shot even further, 3s are an aspect of the game, but not the totality."

In college there isn't fighting but I definitely took on the agitator role and took a beating every night and I willingly put the target on my back.

"Ham_Solo7","2","Sun Feb 16 02:08:40 2020 UTC","Its crazy that we actually once had 4 all stars on the same team, Jones, Nick, Shaq, Kobe. Yeah the former 2 wasn't exactly perennial candidate but still good players."

"mrjowei","52","Sun Feb 16 00:57:13 2020 UTC","It's not pointless. The ASG is one of the most viewed basketball events so Kobe's name will always be in the limelight."

"multiple4","37","Sun Feb 16 00:59:13 2020 UTC","It's not pointless lol. He has like 8 of them so it makes sense anyways I think a lot of you guys need to understand that we don't have to retire his number leaguewide and change the logo etc to honor Kobe. Just because something isn't the most extreme possible way to honor him doesn't mean that those ways are any better than changing the name of the All Star MVP. They're all equal. Honoring Kobe is whatever each person makes it. One way isn't better than the other"
"durktrain","5","Sun Feb 16 02:33:34 2020 UTC","Yeah honestly. How many players have any award named after them? This is a good way to honor him and a great move by the NBA. Logo change is far too extreme and reactionary imo but this is perfect"
"victor396","54","Sun Feb 16 00:51:52 2020 UTC","It's not pointless if players start to try in the game itself.

"JIKBestAlbum2019","5","Sun Feb 16 01:34:04 2020 UTC","Instead of looking at it glass half-empty, look at it like this: The NBA has been honoring him in so many ways, this is just another positive addition to the list."

"henstobs11","1","Sun Feb 16 01:12:41 2020 UTC","Kobe All Star MVP basically represents who gave the most effort in a game that lets you help a charity. If I'm choosing 1 thing to be able to define Kobe's legacy as an NBA player, I'll choose him being the one that gave back as much as he could. To the people, to the fans, to the players. He might not be top 1 top 3 top 5 or even top 10 for most fans/analysts/media but he damn sure is up there at the top for most players. I think it fits him well. He was an all arounder in real life. Basketball great, creative artist, Oscar winner (fuck yea), great writer, eloquent speaker, role model, family man, girl dad. True All Star."

"baymax18","269","Sun Feb 16 00:33:30 2020 UTC","It really is the fit that makes the most sense. Changing the name of the finals mvp would be overcompensating and he deserved something that would be a desirable honor. Really great job by Silver and the NBA here"
"slysonic7","153","Sun Feb 16 00:39:59 2020 UTC","Isn't the Finals MVP named after Bill Russell? That's why I wasn't for changing that or the logo; Kobe deserves to be honored but not at the expense of someone else who also deserves it."
"latotokyo123","102","Sun Feb 16 00:42:10 2020 UTC","Exactly. And changing the name to him when he has 2, which 5 people have more (MJ, Magic, Shaq, Duncan, and LeBron), would feel forced"
"BubbaTee","18","Sun Feb 16 00:43:11 2020 UTC","The only argument against that for the logo was that Jerry West didn’t want to be on it. But the NBA never acknowledged it was Jerry West so it would be weird if it was officially Kobe."
"multiple4","116","Sun Feb 16 01:45:31 2020 UTC","the NBA never acknowledged it was Jerry West If they admitted it was based on a specific person they'd owe royalties to that person whenever it's used commercially - which is pretty much every piece of NBA merchandise."
"MyUsername0_0","79","Sun Feb 16 01:01:49 2020 UTC","Also even if it's Jerry West, the logo looks like a generic NBA player which is what it should look like. The NBA is not one player. It's all of them, and Kobe is probably the 3rd most legendary player in the history of the NBA, behind Jordan and Lebron I think the ASG MVP trophy is a very appropriate and good way to honor Kobe leaguewide"
"multiple4","26","Sun Feb 16 01:10:56 2020 UTC","It’s probably really expensive to change the logo as well. It’s on literally everything"
"peterpeterpeter12321","16","Sun Feb 16 01:13:19 2020 UTC","That too. It's just really impractical and I think most people would agree with that now.

"DGBD","23","Sun Feb 16 01:19:52 2020 UTC","i agree, the all star game mvp is the perfect amount of appropriateness"
"Bill_Ender_Belichick","3","Sun Feb 16 02:40:06 2020 UTC","It's all of them, and Kobe is probably the 3rd most legendary player in the history of the NBA, behind Jordan and Lebron I feel like there's a ton of recency bias in this statement. He was a generational guy for sure but I think it's tough to call one guy who's still playing and one guy who only stopped 5 years ago as two of the three most legendary players. Especially considering historic guys like Magic, Bird, Wilt, and Russell. I don't think Kobe's legacy needs this kind of hyperbole."
"NewestBalance6","3","Sun Feb 16 05:16:28 2020 UTC","How many people have yelled “KOBE!!” as they toss a piece of paper in the trash? A lot."
"DGBD","6","Sun Feb 16 03:45:30 2020 UTC","Completely disagree. Basketball is as popular as it is today around the world thanks to Kobe Bryant not Magic Bird and Russel. Kobe is one of the most ionic and influential players to ever play the game and that can't be disputed."
"Bill_Ender_Belichick","2","Sun Feb 16 03:58:21 2020 UTC","To a certain extent I guess it depends on your definition of ""legendary,"" ""iconic,"" and all the rest. I do think you discount a lot of what Bird and Magic and that era did to popularize the sport in the US, without which the massive global expansion wouldn't have been possible. Hell, it was even going global in that era. I talked to a guy in Buenos Aires last year who had never been to the States, but had fallen in love with basketball and the Celtics while watching Larry bird back in the 80s. But I can see your point with the global expansion. You'll see more jerseys of those three players abroad than most other jerseys for sure. Still, that foundation was built on the legacies of other players. In 20 or 30 years time there will be a whole new set of jerseys that will be the biggest and best, but I don't know if that would then qualify those players to claim ""most legendary"" status. I'd also argue that things like Chamberlain's 100 point game or Russell's crazy dynasty are ""legendary"" in the sense that they're part of the lore of the NBA. Jordan's flu game and Kobe's 81 points are also good examples. But those are on-court legends, and so much of what Kobe, Lebron, and MJ did was off-court. They brought branding and superstardom to a whole new level, which has added to their iconic status. Even a guy like Shaq, the better player during that Lakers run with Kobe (and IMO the better player, period) and a super compelling personality, just can't compete with the brand that Kobe developed."
"wildwestington","28","Sun Feb 16 05:15:25 2020 UTC","It took me a while to realize it’s even supposed to be a specific person when I started following basketball. I really don’t see it still, it’s very generic."

"leviticus7","4","Sun Feb 16 00:45:35 2020 UTC","West doesn’t want to be the logo and the NBA never admitted West was the inspiration for the logo."
"DoctorZzzzz","3","Sun Feb 16 02:38:38 2020 UTC","The logo isn’t technically anyone. The NBA refuses to acknowledge it is Jerry West and instead says it’s a generic player. Everyone knows that it is West, but officially it isn’t."
"davemoedee","2","Sun Feb 16 03:25:26 2020 UTC","Definitely. Also Kobe having a near record if not record number of all star selections, this fits way better."

I say Mamba Mentality to myself whenever I'm struggling to do anything, whether it be another rep at the gym, staying focused and in the moment, loving my wife, or at work when it's late and I need to slam out that time sensitive assignment.

Closest I'd ever gotten to tears was Carrie Fisher, but I don't think that really made me cry. I feel all this. Carrie Fisher hit pretty tough, but Kobe....? My niece texted me and I was like GTFOOH. Then alerts started hitting my phone.?????"
"calior","5","Sun Jan 26 23:35:56 2020 UTC","Can someone explain to my husband that it is perfectly reasonable for me to be fucking gutted and bawling my eyes out over this? Fuck. Grew up an Angelino, but don’t live there anymore. He’s from the East Coast so he doesn’t get the impact Kobe had on those of us who grew up there."
"robbie_rva","4","Mon Jan 27 02:06:13 2020 UTC","Kobe was a player that showed his passion on the court every night. Lakers fans saw him grow up playing under Shaq's Shadow and see him mature. He struggled when the team was just based around him and then learned how to elevate players at every level of the roster. He was beautiful to watch on the court. It feels like something is missing in the world without him. I was born in Georgia and Ive loved my life on Virginia and Colorado but Kobe meant something special to me as well. Kobe was an inspiration to people, and especially an inspiration to his daughter. Having a dad believe in you like that means the world to any kid. I cried today because I thought of playing basketball with my own dad. I thought of what life would be like if I lost him or he lost me. I thought about what my mom or sisters would feel like. It's perfectly reasonable to be upset by tragic events. There was a terrible and senseless loss today. The world lost a loving father and a daughter who was following his steps. I cried when I saw the pictures of GiGi and the clips of her highlights. I don't see anything else to do but cry."
"HeyImMarlo","1161","Sun Jan 26 19:49:44 2020 UTC","Horrible news, but thankfully he lived his life the way most people should strive to. Life can end at any moment, and he tried his hardest in any endeavor and made himself a legend. Of course people should be sad, but don't forget what he left behind for inspiration."
"sudd3nclar1ty","192","Sun Jan 26 20:04:46 2020 UTC","Tragic. Very sad to lose a legend so early in life. Kobe Bean was making huge strides in the entertainment industry as well. I really feel for his kids. He seemed like a great father. Horrible news."

LA times twitter is telling people they are doing their best for independent confirmation. Edit3: International media is picking up on it, some pretty big publications like ""Daily Mail"".

In how he transition with such grace his retirement. And how he changed the game, all he did good or bad it was special. His mindset was unique and I felt like in my life situation I approached everything with that determination and atill do. Such an amazing person and complete of achievements in success in everything in life.

I am on a plane from Reno to LA crying like a baby. So sad for his family, friends, the Lakers organization, the NBA, and of course for all of us - his fans. I watched his first game. I went to his last game. I celebrated his victories like they were my own. I remember that giddy kid I met in the NBC cafeteria when he went on Leno and asked if he could have one of my french fries. I looked forward to seeing that accomplished man give a speech when he is inducted into the HOF later this year. We all loved him, even when he made it hard to like him. May he Rest In Peace."

"CaptRon25","5","Sun Jan 26 20:44:07 2020 UTC","I honestly couldn’t NOT be there. Before the game started I turned to my buddy and said, ‘Watch him put up like fifty shots tonight,’ half-kidding. What I will never forget was that Kobe’s last play on that floor was actually, and ironically, an assist. He wrote his own story in basketball. He did things his way. He had an almost supernatural level of intelligence when it came to the game and his role in it. There will never be another Kobe Bryant."

I was enjoying and told my uncle that I was applying Mamba Mentality to conquer the hike because I’ve been dedicated to bettering myself and losing weight. Had no service for a good while and then as I was coming back and about .5 mile from the start I started getting flooded with messages asking if I was ok. I read what happened and I cried. I looked out into the horizon looking at the city and cried. I cried for Kobe. I cried for his family. I cried for all of us hurting in Laker Nation and the world. This has to be a dream."

A few hours later, I got on a bus back, heard the news over the radio and I'd never felt my heart drop so hard. I had to get off the bus about 30 minutes early because I just wanted to walk and try to process what had happened. Absolutely heartbreaking. Keep your head up, man."

Guys I could root against during our games but had the upmost respect for on and off the court. Without the rivalry and Kobe, those finals would’ve been so much less enjoyable.

Throughout the years, no one ever took me seriously for liking the sport. Seeing him treat his daughters, especially Gigi and her love of basketball, with so much respect... man. I’ve stuck with the lakers through thick and thin, and this was our year. This was the year everything was supposed to go well. But Kobe dying? Even if he’s not on the team anymore, he IS the lakers.

He even played point guard at times and bossed it."

He is legitimately uneasy and confused why he broke Kobe's scoring record in Philly as a Laker where Kobe grew up, and where LeBron first met Kobe as a high schooler. Kobe gave 15 yr old LeBron a pair of shoes the night before Kobe won all star game mvp in Philly. He kept saying it didn't make sense. Probably too much coincidence for his own comfort and it wasn't sitting well with him, perhaps too much responsibility to handle. He said how great it is seeing Kobe and Gigi at the games because the Lakers are a brotherhood. 14 hours later, Kobe and Gigi would leave this Earth for good. LeBron was right, none of this makes sense. All we can do is pick the pieces up and honor their memories by pushing forward."

"hopsandhorns","241","Mon Jan 27 15:03:49 2020 UTC","This one was the worst. I been in a haze all day yesterday. Been watching all the clips, all the blurbs, condolences. Woke up today hoping it wasn't true, but it still is. This one sucks so hard."
"Mr_Supotco","6","Mon Jan 27 16:40:56 2020 UTC","Honestly, I held it together all day yesterday then couldn’t sleep and spent a few hours just reading stuff, watching videos, and finally breaking down. I woke up this morning and it just still doesn’t feel real, like it was just a rumor or a bad dream"

"BigBambooStick42","56","Mon Jan 27 15:14:31 2020 UTC","I couldn’t sleep either bro. Had no idea it was going to affect me the way it has. Watching him play on TV and do superhuman things as a kid with my friends around me will always be a part of my childhood. I got gradually sadder as the day went on and tossed and turned all night thinking about his wife and family after losing him and Gigi. This is so sad."
"aguilar_s24","4","Mon Jan 27 15:15:47 2020 UTC","Bro it didn’t hit me til around 2am and I legit cried for like 30 mins. I haven’t been sad about an athletes death that much since Eddie Guerrero dies when I was like 10"

"Vitalynk","5","Mon Jan 27 14:39:27 2020 UTC","Crying like a baby for hours helped me go to sleep... I didn't even get to know about basketball (and Kobe) for years and years like so many of you here, but seeing my bf's role model die was just too much. Even now, we're still numb, not believing it happened. It's just a nightmare awake."

"Stretch127","29","Mon Jan 27 13:57:19 2020 UTC","Work nightshift. Woke up randomly around 3pm yesterday and saw the headlines. Im like nah somebody is hacking Reddit hard. Then went back to sleep like no way is that real stop messing with me. I'm still in disbelief honestly waiting for someone to early April fools me."
"5213","5","Mon Jan 27 16:20:44 2020 UTC","I woke and while I was making breakfast I was thinking, ""well how do they know it was Kobe's helo?"" and then I realized what a dumb thought that was and then I was sad all over again"
"UnObtainium17","630","Mon Jan 27 15:44:49 2020 UTC","My favorite Kobe quote. Something we all can relate to in tough times. He said this to GOrdon Hayward after that horrible leg injury. “Be sad. Be mad. Be frustrated. Scream. Cry. Sulk. When you wake up you will think it was just a nightmare only to realize it’s all too real. You will be angry and wish for the day back, the game back THAT play back. But reality gives nothing back and nor should you. Time to move on and focus on doing everything in your power to prepare for surgery, ask all the questions to be sure you understand fully the procedure so that you may visualize it in your subconscious while being operated on and better the chance of it’s success. Then focus on the recovery process day by day by day. It’s a long journey but if you focus on the mini milestones along the way you will find beauty in the struggle of doing simple things that prior to this injury were taken for granted. This will also mean that when you return you will have a new perspective. You will be so appreciative of being able to stand, walk, run that you will train harder than you ever have. You see the belief within you grow with each mini milestone and you will come back a better player for it. Best of luck to you on this journey my brother #mambamentality always.” https://www.instagram.com/p/BaZQjy1gyv2/?hl=en"
"yurtyybomb","87","Mon Jan 27 17:42:03 2020 UTC","This is really apt and probably exactly what Kobe would say to us now, changing the stuff about surgery to be about moving on from death. The hardest parts, though, are the bits about ""recovery"" from a surgery vs. recovering from a death. Ugh."

"xElectricW","464","Mon Jan 27 15:34:02 2020 UTC","Honestly, he could have 3 statues outside of Staples and it would be fitting. One as #8 - would love if this was something with Shaq too. One as #24 - to highlight when he really made the Lakers his own. Would love something like him standing on the scorers table, arms stretched out after winning the championship. One with him and Gigi - something as simple as them sitting courtside, him teaching her about the game and just enjoying his life after retirement; an image I think most of us are more than familiar with since he stopped playing."
"fadimanrules","355","Mon Jan 27 12:45:55 2020 UTC","I was behind giving him 2, one for 8 and one for 24 but we need one celebrating him as a man. Hopefully they build this to celebrate how special the bond between Kob and Gigi was"

"OVOYorge","113","Mon Jan 27 14:26:04 2020 UTC","That's too much money for the NBA to pass up imo, maybe a plaque or memorial chairs and they can charge a special premium for the Kobe seats. That sounds more like something owners would do. I'm a fan of the idea I'm just making a twisted joke about greed I mean we see players regularly get injured because the NBA refuses to move back the cameramen or court side seats to leave some space."
"Redtwooo","39","Mon Jan 27 14:59:54 2020 UTC","Valencia CF, a soccer team in Spain put a statue of one of their fans in the stadium seats. The fan was a life long fan that went to every single game growing up. When he got older the fan became blind, missed a couple games and said fuck it, I am going back to the games because although I cannot see it, I can at least hear and feel the atmosphere of the fans. This year is also the 100th year of the clubs existence but sadly the fan passed away. The club built a statue of the fan and he remains there all season. HERE is the video Valencia CF made to dedicate it to the fan. Some real tear jerk stuff HERE is the picture of the stadium with the fan's statue"
"azzLife","11","Mon Jan 27 15:42:17 2020 UTC","To be fair, he wasn't courtside and the football stadium holds more than twice as many people as the Staples Center"

"VictoriousRaptor","174","Mon Jan 27 14:43:01 2020 UTC","You’re being downvoted but you’re absolutely correct. No shot they leave two court side seats like that empty forever. However a plaque or something would be awesome."
"WangShunLee","71","Mon Jan 27 14:29:16 2020 UTC","Lol, the Lakers can afford to put a couple seats away. NBA has no say in the first place."

"barath_s","14","Mon Jan 27 12:16:21 2020 UTC","I'm from Portugal, 35yo. When I was growing up, on Sunday afternoons there was an ""NBA Action"" program on TV in which we followed Michael Jordan's greatest accomplishments. It was awesome but I was a little young to fully appreciate the game and the GOAT. Fast forward to high school, my class is merged with the sports students curriculum and we have this friend of ours who is ALL Kobe Bryant. The only kid with a huge NBA Jersey in school, and in P.E. he does all the Kobe moves, and does them well. We bonded over basketball and I get back into watching NBA at 23pm, 00pm, 01am, just to see Kobe & company, and he was amazing. Became my favorite, even over Jordan. We haven't spoke >10 years, but today that colleague was the first person I messaged when I saw the news. He's crushed and so am I. RIP Mamba."

"Aseldo","863","Mon Jan 27 16:04:27 2020 UTC","I’m an NBA fan moved to the US from China seven years ago. I just want to share how great influence Kobe Bryant has in China. Yesterday’s news hit me really hard, and I didn’t know how to process it. Many times, I woke up from sleep last night, and I still couldn’t believe that it was true. I opened my Chinese social media WeChat, and all I could see was that everyone was posting photos of Kobe and mourning for him. I mean literally everyone, from hardcore basketball fans to people who seemed to have no interest in the sport at all. Even my 85 year old grandma wrote something about Kobe. That’s how I realize Kobe’s legacy has went beyond countries and sports. MJ made NBA a global sport in the 1990s, Yao opened the door of NBA for the Chinese fans in the early 2000s, and Kobe was the face of the league in that era. It’s safe to say that Kobe is THE biggest international athlete in China. In the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games Opening Ceremony, Kobe was the only non-Chinese athlete who got over 10 seconds screen time on the CCTV (Chinese Central TV). After the Daryl Murray incident last year, the CCTV hasn’t broadcast one single game or any NBA news including the pass of David Stern. However, CCTV decided to air the news for Kobe this time. “Have you seen Los Angeles at 4 AM? I see it often because that’s when I start training.” Almost every Chinese basketball fan can tell you this quote from Kobe. “Los Angeles at 4 AM” has since become the symbol of hard-working and persistence in Chinese pop culture. Students studying hard for exams, workers working long hours, people from all walks of life have been using this phrase to encourage each other. They may not know how many championship rings Kobe had or who Black Mamba was, but Mamba Mentality has already planted it roots in a country thousands miles away encouraging people everyday to go out and be the best of themselves. I believe Kobe would be in his great signature smile if he knew this. Thank you ???"
"ListenBruv","471","Tue Jan 28 08:15:31 2020 UTC","Los Angeles at 4am. I love that."
"MadSpaceYT","137","Mon Jan 27 11:47:12 2020 UTC","I’ll never forget you Kobe, you’ll always be my favorite player. I love you."
"joelinoo","6","Mon Jan 27 13:53:06 2020 UTC","I don’t post often on reddit anymore but I wanted to leave a message on this thread because Kobe meant a lot to me. I started watching basketball religiously in 1998 when I saw Kobe drop 33 points in one half against the Magic. After that, he was easily my favourite player. I followed the entirety of his career - I watched him get booed in Philly at the ASG, I saw him demand a trade, I saw players and fans turn on him, and then I saw the greatest redemption story in sports - the championships, the reconciliation with Shaq, and now, the mentor role he had taken with today's players. I have never dealt with death before and when I first heard the news yesterday I went numb. It sounded like a fake headline. I just kept saying ""WHAT?!"" over and over. Legends aren't supposed to die randomly at 41 on a routine flight to a basketball game. I cried seeing Trae Young's instagram post. I cried seeing Shaw crack. I cried seeing Jay Williams cry. It was okay to cry. This morning I woke up and it still all just felt like a dream. It doesn't sound real. It can't be real. Kobe - thank you for giving me some of the best moments of my life. Watching you hit the game winner against the Suns in 06 allowed me to yell and scream in jubilation at my brother who always rooted against you; seeing you win the championship in 09 allowed me to run around my college residence screaming at the top of my lungs; your final 60 point game allowed me to share my favourite player's last game with my now wife. You touched my life and my mentality towards success In so many ways. RIP Kobe and Gianna."
"NewTech20","7","Mon Jan 27 14:51:17 2020 UTC","I cried seeing Trae Young's instagram post. I cried seeing Shaw crack. I cried seeing Jay Williams cry. It was okay to cry. Doc Rivers bro. Shit gets me"
"henstobs11","686","Mon Jan 27 15:11:26 2020 UTC","Yeah that was gut wrenching ?"
"SharksFanAbroad","115","Mon Jan 27 15:09:12 2020 UTC","I could've written this myself. Much love fellow fan. Life is cruel sometimes - hold onto your family and appreciate your time with them."
"wobarbitrage","7","Mon Jan 27 12:06:29 2020 UTC","Tried taking my mind off of what happened to Kobe and decided to go for a walk. In 2 hours of walking I passed by 5 public courts all packed with ballers of different generations, everyone wearing Kobe gear. Even passed by a group of guys pouring one out for the Mamba while watching highlights. Even when the news came out, my family members (except my dad who is also a bball fan) who know nothing about basketball, especially the NBA, came up to me and quickly asked me how I was doing. They know how much Kobe means to me. This is actually fucking stupid because I've never experienced grieving for someone. Grandparents died before I was born and the ones I grew up with up until now - my family and friends- are all still complete. Kobe's death is literally the first experience of grief I've ever had and shit's just so heavy. Never felt as bad as this even when other celebrities/musicians I idolized died. And I say all of this as a person who got into the NBA because of Shaq, yes when they feuded and Shaq was traded I was on his side and treated Kobe as the villain. From being a bench player up until winning an Oscar, I've followed Kobe. I went through all sorts of feelings from liking him, despising him, loving him but I damn sure respected him through all of it. I was so looking forward to Kobe's post-playing life. Shows, documentaries, commentating games, talk show appearances, mentoring new players, future WNBA courtside perfect attendance dad and now those are all just what ifs. Feel sorry for his family especially his wife, it's only been 6 months since the youngest was born. She has to go through all that without Kobe. I never want to know how it feels to lose a partner and a child at the same time and I hope nobody else does. Life is fucking brutal."
"Rockstar408","1920","Mon Jan 27 12:52:34 2020 UTC","Ugh. Told myself not to even try redditing today. You summed it up beautifully. Might have to be away for a while, just painful to read it all."

"thisisdewaybruda","105","Mon Jan 27 11:47:31 2020 UTC","I’ve never really been hit hard by a celebrity death before. But this one has really gotten to me. Kobe meant so much to me as a player and as a person. I will never forget that gut wrenching feeling I had when I woke up to the news of the accident. It’s also so incredibly sad that his daughter, only 13, didn’t get to live the life she deserved to have. You can’t help but think about what Vanessa is going through right now after losing her husband and daughter. This is just unbelievable, it hasn’t set in yet and I don’t think it will for a while. Although he won’t be there to make his speech, his Hall or Fame induction is going to be one to remember. The man was 41, he had just 4 years as a full time parent and he had a whole life ahead of him that he didn’t get to experience. Gianna’s dreams of playing in the WNBA and continuing on the Bryant legacy is no longer a possibility. She was a 13 year old kid, her life had hardly begun before it was taken away. Kobe, you were a true legend of the game and an inspiration to me and millions of others. You won’t ever be forgotten."
"macabre_irony","5","Mon Jan 27 12:42:06 2020 UTC","I didn’t expect a celebrity death to hit me this hard either. Usually it’s sad, but not decimating. This left me feeling like I didn’t want to do anything for the rest of the day yesterday. And I still felt weird when I woke up this morning. I’m usually one to look on the bright side of things, but it’s hard with this. It’s too tragic."
"cloudJR","53","Mon Jan 27 13:26:09 2020 UTC","I woke up for my night shift and saw the news yesterday. I cried for about 2 hours before going in. I didn't want to talk to anyone or even have to function. Celebrity deaths don't usually impact me but damnnn this one hurt. This man inspired an entire globe! Bigger than basketball. More than athlete. Much love Kobe ??????"
"neoda1","7","Mon Jan 27 15:29:17 2020 UTC","There's really no other way to put it except that it just hurts. To watch the evolution of not only his game and basketball career but even more so the man that he would be become has been amazing. You could see as the years went on he traded bravado for confidence yet never wavered in his commitment to the game. As he matured he began letting the layers peel off so the world could see what was inside. From this cocky kid with a chip on his shoulder and everything to prove to this decorated champion with all the accolades and nothing left to prove. He gave us two brilliant halves of his basketball career, #8 and #24, and I'm saddened the world doesn't get to see what he would have done in the second half of his amazing life. Damn...damn...damn..."
"lorzbotavara","7","Mon Jan 27 13:50:42 2020 UTC","I think we can all relate with you today. When the news broke it was crippling and didn't feel real. When TMZ's site went down I was on Kobe's Twitter refreshing it for nearly 10 minutes hoping he would tweet out it wasn't real. I had to leave the room from my wife and daughter a few times to let out my emotions but it got to the point where I just had to grieve and we all just supported each other. All we can do is take it one day at a time and keep the Bryant family in our prayers."

"DaeSd","11","Mon Jan 27 17:55:32 2020 UTC","Dear Kobe, You broke my heart. My Spurs flair alone is probably testament enough to that. I was just young enough that His Airness was starting to ride off into the sunset, so my entire childhood you haunted me (Derek Fisher and 0.4 notwithstanding) and after the three-peat I thought we were safe. But seeing you so effortlessly and ruthlessly handle teams, including mine, even in your down years, kept me checking under my bed for The Boogeyman wearing 8. I wasn't the only one you haunted. You came back. Really, you never left. From the mid to the late 00's you crept, you metamorphosed into a devil in purple and gold, The Black Mamba, Number 24. I thought you the Destroyer of Worlds. You willed 81 points into the history books using your blood, sweat, and tears. You dragged the ancient Celtic-Lakers battles of the past into the present day, kicking and screaming, and laid them bare before us, daring us to find a more important historical backbone to this league that we love. You were a historian, making history. Vino. A boogeyman less and less everyday, but someone who still found another gear, and made every game close when he visited the Alamo City in his twilight years. Even in your last year, the farewell tour you wanted to avoid, you pushed foes, stars, young and old, to their brink, even as you were hobbled and limped off the floor some nights. And then April 13th, 2016 you chose to burn your name into the stars one last time. All those hurts and pain you had inflicted when I watched you, they washed away for one night, and I was your biggest fan. We all were. You were down, the Jazz looked to have the game locked up, and the youngbloods on the team were passing you the ball so you could at least go out scoring in what looked to be your final loss. 4th quarter. 82-70 Utah. 9:38 left in the game. Left in your career. You had 37. Your J was gone, and I saw, truly, that you were just a man, heaving, huffing, puffing, drenched in sweat. But one last time, you wanted to be The Boogeyman. You kept finding the basket. I kept screaming in joy for this Laker dream crusher. It was almost a religious experience, I couldn't believe what I was watching. In what felt like a blink of the eye, you had 60 points, the Jazz had collapsed in the face of your immutable will, and the Staples Center sounded like it would come crashing down. Mamba Out. You left. The game was a little emptier. You became an elder statesman more and more everyday, and important to a new generation. You breathed life into a poem and won an Oscar. You were the next Bill Russell. I wondered what you'd say at his funeral. Your own Hall of Fame induction. But now? All I'm left wondering is what will Russell say at yours? Jordan? The Zen Master? Superman? Tim, Manu, and Tony? The King? What would Gianna have changed about the WNBA? What ripples would those other lost souls that day have made? Yesterday, you did it again, Kobe Bryant. You broke my heart. RIP Edit: Cleaned up minor grammar issues I couldn't see earlier through the tears."

Didn't want to die but it wasn't a scary thing for me. But then I had kids. The thought of not being there, of not being able to watch them grow and flourish and not being able to help them along the way scares me. My thoughts are with his family who lost him and a daughter/ sister. And also to the other families. This is already a difficult time and seeing photos of the wreckage on the media cannot help. Such a loss, so sad."

"therealmarkus7478","342","Mon Jan 27 11:55:01 2020 UTC","Mods deleted my post, so. Wrote this when he retired and it's the same reasons I hurt then why I hurt like hell now: I remember the first time I learned about the NBA. My family would go to Manila to visit family and as an eight year old, my instinct was to skip the hugs and kisses and head straight to my uncle’s computer cafe to play games. One of the games on the PCs happened to be NBA Live 2001. I am by no means an athletic child or a particularly adept gamer, but I was thrilled by the sport being played out before me. My older cousins had all chosen to play as the Lakers, so of course, I did too. They seemed the most debonair, with their gold jerseys edged with purple. A few months after, I saw my first NBA game. It was grainy footage played on VCR at a relative’s house. The game was May 13, 2001, Game 4 of Lakers vs. Kings in the Western Conference Semifinals. At one point, a slim guard with an afro missed a layup then fought through 3 other players (all taller and bigger than him) to get his own offensive rebound and make the basket in his second try. He was, in a sport meant to be played as a team, an individual. Even then, #8 struck me as selfishly absorbed in the game. This man--playing a sport I knew nothing about and in a country over 8,000 miles away from mine--understood what it was to have a singular purpose: to win. I was ten years old when my family moved to America. I started 5th grade in December and tried to learn how the country worked. I would spend everyday at recess walking back and forth on the concrete edge between grass and woodchips, talking to myself. At home I’d go on YouTube and watch the viral videos of the 00s--Numa Numa, Badger Badger Snake, Smosh, and--of course--basketball highlights. Eventually, I learned where to find live streams of games. I read articles and studied every statistic. I went on basketball forums and blogs and learned how to trash talk with the best of them. Being a Laker fan made me feel part of a community, even as I remained alien at school and in my actual community. Being a Kobe fan helped me feel alright with that. Kobe never seemed to care about his teammates. He never seemed to care about glory or fame. He did not even seem to care about being labeled a criminal all that much. During that time, he looked mostly irritated that his mind had to be preoccupied with something other than basketball. It was comforting to watch someone be so consumed with not failing that he drove himself to heights of greatness beyond what he was supposed to. It was encouraging to know that someone can be so consumed by not failing that he often drove himself to failure. I cried myself to sleep because my classmates made fun of my accent. Then I spent hours reading books and looking up how unfamiliar words were pronounced. I would say them over and over until I pronounced them correctly, like an American. My mother would open my door and ask why I was talking to myself. I learned how to make relevant cultural references, what music to listen to, and made friends. I was quickly seen as the straight-A nerd, a leader in the community and the various clubs I was in. I graduated high school in three years and made it to a top public university where I found success as a student and in my job. All effort was made into a singular purpose: to win. I worked so hard and was so consumed with not failing that I drove myself to insanity. Every perceived failure was a devastating blow to my ego. I would beat myself up over and over until I got it right. Through it all I watched Kobe going through the same experiences. The triumph of a made buzzer beater that would win us the game. The tragedy of trying to take over because he would not bring himself to trust his teammates, so he would end up making 21% from the field and lose the game for us. During games when he was missing every shot, Kobe seemed unable to control himself. He would keep firing missed jumper after missed jumper. I’m not gonna stop, the blank stare seemed to say, until I get it right. When I read his retirement letter, I cried. I cried not because basketball is losing one of its greatest players, or because he never did surpass Jordan. I cried because when I watch basketball next year, I’m going to look out into that court and no longer see a kindred spirit. So, to Kobe: Thank you. Thank you for having a will so stubborn that for years, you would not accept you were human. Thank you for a goodbye letter that was not addressed to your teammates, your fans, your family, nor your friends, but to the sport. Thank you for the sincere love you have for what you chose to do. Thank you for having no other purpose other than to over-achieve. Thank you. Because even though we, with you being a 6 foot 6 inch tall incredibly athletic black man and me being a 5 foot tall completely unfit and slightly chubby Filipina woman, could not be any more different, we carry a same singularity of purpose that made me feel less alone. Always, A fan. *EDIT: Thank you for the silvers and gold and the supportive comments. It helps that I'm not alone in mourning. Hope everyone has a good day."

Anyway, I didn't want to fangirl or anything. I just kinda lined up our paths and held out a fist as I walked by. He fist bumped me and gave a little nod. And that was that. Just a dope little memory of mine that he surely never remembered but I never forgot.

"PrecedentialAssassin","11","Mon Jan 27 15:55:13 2020 UTC","I have tried to put into words why Kobe's death affected me so hard, and I think I finally came to the decision that it was because: he was invincible. He was a different kind of star. Most athletic stars do things that we didn't think were humanly possible. But Kobe did things that we didn't think were possible from him he accomplished things by a sheer force of will that he was written off from doing. Like hitting 2 free throws with a torn Achilles, or putting up 60 in his last game. RIP GOAT"

"Man0nTheMoon915","71","Mon Jan 27 17:04:07 2020 UTC","I assured my wife last night that I was sad about this loss a LITTLE bit but not like I was seeing everyone else reacting to it, and mind you, I'm a huge Lakers and Kobe fan. My wife, not being largely into any sports in general, wanted to know what was so great about this guy that people are feeling like this. I explained that his achievements as a player are unquestionably worth all praise but ultimately it's just a game and there are far greater things to shed tears about... Then, after a long pause, I said, ""I'll tell you what DOES make me sad about this is his family..."" and suddenly I burst into tears and I couldn't stop crying and I couldn't talk and my wife, surprised, starting quietly crying too. After a little composure, I explained that the saddest part to this story is his family, his wife, his other daughters, who finally, after taking a back seat, patiently waiting for Dad to chase his dreams and silence his critics and slay his demons, FINALLY get Dad to themselves, only to get three brief years, no doubt the best three years they've had as a family thus far, to now have to find it in themselves to try to move on and try to carry the torch of the ""Mamba Mentality"". I feel so sad now and I get the sadness everyone is feeling. It forces me to grieve my personal losses because it's not the games he played that's causing people's grief. It's the mortality we all face, the realization that unfortunate events cannot be tamed or stopped or bought or influenced by fame, fortune, goals or good intentions. He was no angel, not perfect, but he acknowledged it, and worked hard to redeem himself and his family. I keep thinking about his last moments and as sad as the images in my imagination are, I certainly hope there was little to no suffering and I hope that being with Gianna made it a little easier for each other. It breaks my heart. I'm so sad. May the Bryant's find peace and comfort soon."
"krucz36","188","Mon Jan 27 17:27:26 2020 UTC","It really gives you pause to stop and appreciate the people in your life. I lost my pops a couple of years ago to pancreatic cancer. He went from seemingly healthy and golfing everyday to gone in a little over a month. You story reminds me of how my daughter handled it. She was 13 at the time. She is a very stoic, unemotional kid and when we got the diagnosis, she didn't really even react. My dad loved golf. He literally played every day. My daughter is also a golfer and a really good one. At 13, she was already shooting mid-high 70s from the women's tees. Pops always bragged about her to his golfing buddies and he loved taking her out to his course and having her play with all of them. A few weeks after we learned that he only had a couple of months left at most, she and I were driving over to my parents to visit with him. She still hadn't cried or reacted to what was happening. We were talking about him and I reminded her of something he always used to say over the past few years back before we learned about the cancer. He used to always say that he had lived a great life but the only thing he really wanted going forward was to live long enough to travel around and watch her play in college. As soon as I said that, she completely broke down and just started bawling. She couldn't stop crying and then I started crying and we had to pull over and just sit there crying and hugging each other. Shit, I'm tearing up typing this out. Its times like these where I hope we can stop and look around at the people around us, the people that we love and that love us and let them know. Call your mom and tell her you love her. Call your grandparents and let them know you thinking about that time that something happened. Grab your kid no matter how old they are and hug them that few extra seconds and let them know that you're proud of them. Whether you're a multi-millioniaire star athlete and a regular guy just trying to get by, the only thing that really makes life meaningful are those people around us."

When I got to college, I wasted away my first quarter with more of the same bad habits I had in high school. Then I watched a postgame interview of Kobe's. And I got into watching more of his videos. The things he said resonated with me. A lightbulb clicked. His message remained constant: ""Put in tireless, relentless effort, and you'll have what you want in life. I guarantee it."" So I did. I spent hours locked away in the library, studying. When I felt like quitting, I asked myself what Kobe would do. And I got my reward. Dean's list, graduated with honors, and a good job out of college. Those are Kobe's honors, not mine. And honestly, they don't even matter. What mattered was the satisfaction of knowing I gave 110% effort. Win or lose, I tried my best and I wouldn't have regretted it regardless of the outcome. I may never have met him, but he impacted me and I'll forever be grateful for him. I'll sum up the wisdom I gained from Kobe for anyone who needs it: Put in the work, put in the time, be obsessed with whatever skill you want to get better at or goal you have for yourself. Let it dominate every thought in your head. Constantly ask yourself how you can improve, even a little bit, today. Ask yourself this every day. One step at a time, keep moving forward. Don't worry about yesterday or about tomorrow, just about taking that one step today. Soon you'll look back and wonder how you got as far as you did"

That means I saw one game and after that just read everything I could. This was pre-internet and I was 9 so it started slowly but surely. Kobe was my favourite player after MJ was done. After a while I decided to hate the Lakers and ”hating” on Lakers was a lot fun because Kobe was so freaking good. I have a lot of good memories of him and I’m grateful to have seen his whole basketball career. I enjoyed still seeing him near the game, like just a while back when he was courtside and shared a moment with Luka. When I got the news I was dumbfounded. I couldn’t believe it. It got more real during the day today. I was keeping the tears in for the whole day at work and when I got home I just let it out. Couldn’t help it. I was surprised... here I am; 36 year old male, crying for a dude I never even met. But I feel like I knew him. I feel like I’m part of a big basketball family today and we all mourn together. There’s something beautiful in all of this. Still wish it wasn’t true. Miss you already Kobe, rest easy. You too Gigi."

She had no idea what I was crying for, and I've never met the guy either. But being 29 now, growing watching the game, playing competitive basketball and Jordan being at the end of his career. He was the one you wanted to be. The pinnacle of greatness. What it was to be a hooper and not ""soft."" He was Superman. So when I read the headlines to me all I saw was that 'Superman is dead' is the only way I can describe it. Because even though I never met Kobe, he was apart of my life almost daily. Even if it was just in the form of watching the game, playing 2K/Live, highlight videos, or just yelling ""Kobe!"" on a shot."
"heartbreakhill","5","Mon Jan 27 15:43:19 2020 UTC","A few years ago I was going through a rough patch in my life. I had an addiction problem, was severely depressed, and had no positive prospects in my life. I spent a lot of nights watching Kobe highlights, watching interviews with him, wishing that I could be like him, or at least have a fraction of his mentality about life so that I too could be a winner. He's always been my favorite basketball player since childhood; I had Lakers gear because of him, one of favorite birthday presents ever was a Kobe signature hoodie and track pants set. During his last season, I got to finally see him play in person for the first time. I was in the nosebleeds and it was just a midseason game, but it was still magical. I was glued to my laptop screen watching him hit 60 during his farewell game, which was so inspiring. I'm doing well today and all of that seems like a distant memory now (including my own troubles) but Kobe was always a lighthouse for me, a perfect example for how to be. I love you Kobe, thanks for everything, I'll miss you and I wish your family strength as they get over the loss of an amazing father and daughter."

"ambitiontowin56","10","Mon Jan 27 15:53:35 2020 UTC","It still doesn't feel real. Basketball has been a huge part of my life ever since I could remember. Even though I spent my 26 years rooting against him and his team, I still had an enormous amount of respect for him on and off the court. Kobe was a different kind of person, there was just something about him. A killer instinct that only a select few athletes have. His personal drive could be felt through the TV. It always felt hopeless when you saw him get going and it was spectacular (also depressing for my team) to watch. I cried on and off all day yesterday, watching/reading all the teams, players, coaches, celebrities, friends, family, and strangers across every sport, fandom, hobby, entertainment medium, and social media sites give tribute to Kobe, his daughter, and the others that were on board. Kobe transcended basketball and sports all together and showed us what hard work can do for someone, Mamba Mentality. Now, as I'm fighting back tears writing this, sitting at my desk, next to my large picture of Jordan guarding Kobe, I feel almost empty. Something is missing, and it won't be filled for a while. I've never owned Laker merch outside of the Lakers Shaq jersey my friend gave me in middle school as a joke (which I buried deep in my closet and never wore) but I think I'm going to break that streak and go get a Kobe jersey in his honor, maybe I'll shadowbox it, who knows? I'll never stop saying your name whenever I'm at the park or throwing away a ball of paper Kobe. I miss you and the basketball world won't be the same without you and your daughter to make your marks. R.I.P. Kobe Bryant and Gianna Bryant"
"Kobe_Bellinger","5","Mon Jan 27 16:54:07 2020 UTC","I’ve been a Lakers fan my whole life, chose to wear #8 on all my soccer teams because of Kobe. I’ve been lucky that I’ve never had to deal with a loss of a loved one or family, I never thought someone’s passing who I never even met would hit me so hard. I thought I had things under control until my Dad texted me. “You have probably heard the news about Kobe by now. One of the best of nights of my life was seeing him go off and sharing it with you. I still have the tickets.” This was a game in 06/07 my that my Dad took me too. Kobe scored 60+ right in front of us. I had no idea my Dad looked at that night so fondly. Reading about how much Kobe loved being a father made me realize that my Dad felt the same way. These small moments we as kids might take for granted really do mean the world to our parents. I turn 30 in a few weeks and this whole tragedy has really made me take a step back and reevaluate what’s important in life. I don’t have much more to say, this is all still very difficult. Just tell your loved ones you love them. Thanks for reading."

But I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t have dumped a body in the Hudson if it meant 20 years of Kobe playing in the north east. He was everything sports should be about. A guy you either love 100% or hate 100% and no in between. But he played the game in a way and left a mark on this sport and this world that is really unmatched and never will be matched. This is truly a devastating tragedy that puts life into perspective in such a fucked up way that you’re reminded of how beautiful it is to be able to celebrate and witness a player like Kobe and how very very important it is to let the people who care about you know you care about them. That’s all that matters in life. RIP Kobe And these are the men we should cry for and celebrate and Prop up and be immortalized for the legendary human beings they were before their life tragically ended. Kobe transcended basketball and seeing him after retirement was just so beautiful to see him enjoying every minute he got to spend with his family. No family deserves to lose their husband and daughter on their way to a basketball game Sunday morning but knowing it was Kobe and his daughter is so surreal. I figured Kobe would just beat the grim reaper in 1on1 forever. He will love on forever thru his basketball accomplishments but Kobe the father and husband is no longer able to be with his family for the rest of their lives and that is truly heartbreaking for me"

I don't think there's another player in our generation so touched by the game, who lived it so completely, who immersed themselves in the history of it, and who was ready in their role to see the sport evolve and curate the wisdom and combined knowledge of the game for those to come. I've been taking this hard. I eulogized him the only way I know how: a morning shootaround workout as soon as the my gym opened at 5 am. I think he would appreciate his death leading to more appreciation for the game. RIP Kobe Bean Bryant"
"iloveyou271","88","Mon Jan 27 16:13:15 2020 UTC","I grew up watching NBA during the Jordan era and slowly watched legend after legend retire until in my mind all the legends had retired, I stopped watching the NBA as being in Australia and without cable it wasn't convenient enough for me to continue to watch. I would always hear the name Kobe, would see his highlights, see him on the cover of games but didn't know anything about Kobe apart from that. My younger brother then got into the sport and he fell in love with Kobe & the Lakers, he would pass his time after work watching Kobe highlights and looking for Kobe merch. His mood will change based off how the Lakers went, If they won I would be forced to watch the game winning play, forced to watch his interviews until it reached a point I was a part of the fandom. Me and my brother bonded over Kobe, last yeah we had the honor to listen to him talk live in Melbourne, he just seemed invincible, live another level of human, strong and bulletproof. Today I was shocked waking up to find he wasn't in fact bullet proof, I had to make my way to my brothers and wake him up to tell him the news, i felt a responsibility to break it to him the same way I felt the responsibility to break the news to him of family passing in the past. He was asleep and i called his name 3 times and he just ignored me so I just said ""Sorry Bro, Kobe died in a helicopter crash"" he jumped up in shock, we would always joke with each other and try to trick each other about believing the stupidest lies but he didn't question this, this wasn't something to joke about. We just sat in silence and from time to time would utter What the fu...... I was a passing fan and am heart broken, I can't imagine what his hardcore fans are feeling let alone his family, it's unbearable to think of his final moments with his daughter, I can only imagine him being clutch and looking to keep her calm in her final moments. RIP Kobe & all on board."

My dad took me out to Lower Merion (only about a 15 minute drive away from where I grew up) to watch your number get retired. I remember the smile you had on your face as you autographed that basketball, the infectious energy you gave off that I couldnt yet fathom at that age, but some how stuck with me even to this day. You had no idea who I was, but you meant so much to me. So much to so many kids growing up in Philly. You gave us the mentality to believe that we can be anything in this silly old city even when the situations around us taught us otherwise. ""basketball is the best metaphore for life"". You said that. That quote has been engraved in my brain since the day I heard it. You and your ""next play"" mentality, your competitiveness to always be great through every trial and tribulation, and to never let your past define you, always move on to the ""next play"". That is the metaphor you left for us and that is the metaphor I plan to carry through out the rest of my life. I was so excited to make it out to the basketball hall of fame this year and see you finally make it into the HOF. I had this crazy plan to seek you and tell you how much you helped me through out my life and that you truly were a huge role model in my life. I guess my crazy plan now is to go to honor the impact you've made in my life, although you had no idea who I was. R.I.P Kobe Bean Bryant."
"Nagasasaki","26","Mon Jan 27 16:46:33 2020 UTC","The truth is, I kinda passionately hated Kobe for most of his career. I found him to be a cocky asshole during his time with Shaq, and then I felt he wrongly ran Shaq out of LA. I viewed him in a even more negative light after the Eagle Colorado incident. During his two finals appearances against the Celtics, I took great pleasure in straight up loathing his existence. And yet, I always had nothing but incredible admiration and respect for his game. It wasn't until his final NBA season where I started to soften my stance against the man. I felt sad he was leaving the NBA. I was happy when the Celtics fans chanted his name as he left his final game in Boston. And then, as I watched him bloom in retirement, I kinda started to love the man. I embraced his Italian upbringing (I'm Italian- American and have spent a lot of time in the country). The way he still spoke Italian so well. The fact that he named all his daughters Italian names. I was moved to tears when he spoke in Italian towards the end of his Oscar award acceptance speech. It wasn't until post-retirement that I saw what he really was. Cocky and brash? Sure. But also insanely intelligent, funny, a man with a huge heart, cool, and living a hugely purposeful life with his countless important endeavors. I straight up became a Kobe fan in recent years. I'd watch his talk show appearances with a smile. Man, I kinda love this dude now, I thought to myself. Even after rooting against him for so many years. I've been completely shaken since hearing the news of his death. It's the combination of the shock of it all, his age, the way he died, and how much he still had in front of him. He worked his ass off to crush it in the NBA for 20 years. Now was the time where he could enjoy himself. Pursue cool endeavors and raise 4 daughters with his wife. Give his HOF speech later this year. Watch his kids grow up, get married, have their own kids. Be a mentor to countless basketball players. Continue all the other cool shit he was doing. That's all gone in a blink of an eye. And it's unfair. Life is unfair. Countless people die young and leave us unexpectedly with so much more ahead of them. A lot of people will say that Kobe accomplished so much in 41 years. And while that is obviously true, it doesn't make it any easier to accept this tragedy. I guess the only thing I can take away from this is to pursue my own dreams. Something I'm guilty of not doing. Something Kobe always seemed to be doing. I don't think any of us will ever truly get over this. It's an enormous loss for the NBA and for the world. I bought a Mamba Academy T-Shirt an hour ago. I will wear that shirt to the gym and think about Kobe and his work ethic and use it as a tool to motivate me towards my dreams. My heart goes out to all the Laker/Kobe fans on this sub. My heart goes all out to his family and friends. Life is fragile and unpredictable and unfair. We gotta honestly try to live every day as best as we can and put the BS to the side for good whenever possible. Much love to you Kobe and Gigi. Godspeed and God bless. Edit - Thank you for the Gold and the kind replies."

Decided it was time to get up and work out to take my mind off it, so I went to the west side YMCA in manhattan. Between sets I walked into the court to checkout the pickup situation. Multiple younger kids wearing Kobe jerseys, and I saw more than one fadeaway accompanied with a ""Kobe"" callout. Almost made me cry, but amazing to see the impact this man had on kids too young to have seen him in his prime. That's how you know we lost an absolute legend yesterday."

"peidnivek","28","Mon Jan 27 16:38:33 2020 UTC","As a Kings fan, Kobe was our most hated rival. I remember my whole family thought he could never do right. He was always arrogant, cocky and selfish. Even my aunt who lived in la would talk shit to the only laker fan in our family. My best friend loved the mamba. We would hang out everyday over summer and we would play ball in the streets and everyday he would try to recreate a new signature mamba move or moment. We would play 2k and he would always use the lakers and shoot lights out with kobe, using that signature mid range turn around fader. As I became an adult i realized big of an influence he had on the game i loved. In my final years of high school i could only play in Kobes. He had the best signature shoe line and the 8s will always be my favorite model ever. I bought his asg 5s soon after and played in them till they fell apart. I remember his final game, where i was housesitting for my coach. I watched every single minute and in his final interview, i sobbed my eyes out. He felt like a rival that i had grew up with. I had not known the NBA without Kobe Bryant. I did not grow up with Magic, Bird and Jordan, so Kobe was the only GOAT I’ve seen play. He will be missed dearly by the world. Goodbye Mamba, may your legacy continue with these young stars that you have influenced so deeply."

"tbor12","26","Mon Jan 27 16:46:36 2020 UTC","For me, since I wasn't necessarily a Kobe fan, the impact has more to do with the NBA. I could see that he was a student of the game. He lived and breathed basketball. I was a fan of his Detail segments on ESPN. I could see that he wanted to enrich others who shared the same love as him, although I cannot see anyone reaching that same level of dedication and love for the game. When I heard that he handpicked NBA players to attend his camp before the NBA season, I knew that he wanted to better the NBA. He wanted to get the best out it's impact players. He wanted to build a pristine product, and gave back to the sport that provided so much for him. I was always a Kobe hater, but only because he was the brick wall that held back my Houston Rockets. After he retired, I became a Kobe admirer. After realizing what he was doing to better the sport, I became a Kobe lover. RIP Mamba. You deserve to be immortalized."

I just turned 30 this past year and it was the first time in my life a death of someone I didn't know, made me cry. Kobe was more than a basketball player to me (and my generation of basketball fans). He was THE face of our generation. He was bigger than basketball and he was invincible. Now that I've gotten older, I've become a fan of who he became off the court and in his post-association life. He had so much more planned and it's unfair he won't get to see it through.

Then he dominated my Suns in the 2010 WCF, it broke my heart. I was even fed up with his farewell tour. And then, I saw Dear Basketball. I watched him sit down with Shaq. I watched him care for all the young guys. I watched his jersey retirement. I watched him talk spanish to people. I watched him work out, and sit courtside with Gigi, and be a proud dad. I listened to Jalen's stories about him. I watched him talk to Luka in his own language. And I grew to like him. Started watching more interviews, even going years back. I was proud, as a basketball lover, to see a family member win an Oscar. I was rooting for Mambacita, couldn't wait to watch her dominate, and see Kobe proud on the sidelines. We started to see the invincible, mysterious become a mortal, one of us, a simple dad - caring not just for her family, but all these kids who grew up idolizing him.

It’s like some immediate family has died. Every time I think about it I’m gut wrenched and Gigi is just making it a million times worse. I know Kobe would have given anything for her not to be involved. We just saw how they were chilling at all those NBA games weeks ago. And that another kid and her parents went too is just too much to handle. Something that really stood out to me, from one of The Athletic podcasts I heard earlier, was that Kobe wasn’t this old head talking about the old days and how weak the league had become. He truly respected, cherished and embraced the next generation of players and genuinely seemed to enjoy the game in its current state. That he will be inducted in the Hall of Fame posthumously seems bizarre. RIP to all 9 onboard. RIP to my hero - you will be missed. You was supposed to be court side at Staples for the next 40 years.

I became a fan of basketball because of him. His absolute love for the game. His determination. Recently I have been trying to stop treating people as legends. They are people just like us. They struggle just like us. But when it comes to Kobe, there is this nostalgia that really makes me feel like he was something else. Like a true hero. I'm not much of a believer when it comes to afterlife. I can only say that as long as I live, I'll be telling how fortunate I was to watch this man play basketball. I would not be the man I'm today without trying to be as determined as he was everyday. What hurts the most is knowing that he would give all the fame and recognition away to save his daughter.

"HauntedandHorny","19","Mon Jan 27 17:26:28 2020 UTC","In Counter Strike, when you killed someone with an HE grenade, you would always yell Kobe. Even that community has been affected by his passing."
"PapaJisinmyhouse","18","Mon Jan 27 15:51:21 2020 UTC","I have never really felt the passing of a celebrity very deep until yesterday. I loved to hate Kobe. I loved beating him in '08 and hated losing to him in '10. He was such a competitor. I was 7 when he was drafted, he was in my life the majority of my life. Seeing his images break my heart. I am trying to be better today and crush work and the gym after work because that's what Mamba would want, but fuck man, this one hurts."
"Simsar","17","Mon Jan 27 16:03:34 2020 UTC","I worked a customer facing job in Vegas for years, and I met a lot of basketball players. I met a few of those more than once, and Kobe was rhe only one who remembered my face and made sure to say “Hey, good to see you again.” when he came back. I don’t know what else to say about him. The basketball didn’t matter, the man did, and he was clearly a superb man who excelled in all aspects of life and believed that anyone else who worked hard could too and wanted us to know it. He cared about people, he was fiercely loyal, and he was blindingly intelligent. He accomplished everything he ever set out to do until he was taken from us. He was a great man, and we lost a lot yesterday."

"Sun0ftheBeach","16","Mon Jan 27 17:23:12 2020 UTC","No one will see this but Kobe in the 2009 finals you changed me from a hater to a fan. No one wanted to win as much as Mamba. He made giants look like children. On and off the court you were a superhero Kobe. Hope you and your daughter are at peace. We love you man. The amount you did with the short time you had cannot be matched by anyone. This one really really fucking hurt. One day I’ll tell my kids about my hero Kobe Bryant. How he followed in the footsteps of MJ but never in his shadow. How he ended AI’s greatest season with a loss. How he ended what should have been a Celtics dynasty by creating his own dynasty. How he went out leaving everything on the court. How he made us cry with Dear Basketball. How he made us laugh with Shaq. How much he did as a coach for a young group of girls. How he always seemed to love his family. He is more than a player. He is one of those human beings who just cannot be replaced. We love you mamba thank you for everything. #24 #8"
"jcar195","18","Mon Jan 27 17:11:33 2020 UTC","I watched Kobe's last game with a mixture of spite and fascination. Knowing someone is leaving is one thing, like graduating you know they'll be around and maybe later on you'll see them here or there. They won't be making your life miserable in the day to day though. I was never a Kobe fan when he played, I loved the Bulls and reminisced about Jordan and Kobe was this imitator that always was close to but never the real thing. That last game kind of made me understand the fascination though. You saw a guy killing himself one last time for the sake of himself and no one else. He went for that 61 and no matter how much it looked like he was burnt up and gassed, he kept going. You could see everyone in the game just going ""fuck it, give it to him man."" and I remember saying to myself This dude has the whole damn arena losing their shit for him and I know exactly why... The years have softened the hard feelings a lot more than I expected. He was funny, he opened up a bit, but that enigmatic feel of him is something I still kind of sensed. He was kind of a nerd and the kind you either liked for his obsessive behavior or shrugged off as being a bit too into himself. Didn't matter either way, he was him and that was all that mattered. Somewhere in that, we all gotta appreciate that being yourself is a fundamental way of being comfortable and succeeding in your own passions. You can't bullshit yourself and I feel Kobe had an understanding that there was always a better version of himself he could be and learned that over the years. From arrogance to wisdom, from hotshot to old veteran. He'll go down as one of the most influential players of the eras and his impact from here on will be one that ripples through more than the league. It'll be one that kids taking the court from the first time to old guys in suits will understand, be yourself and always be striving to improve on the principle of being better than you were yesterday."

Michael Jackson died in 2009, I was only 14. I wasn't really a kid but I was too young honestly to really understand the way I do now, and I'm also a father myself now. I've been a Kobe fan for as long as I can remember. The fact I'll never see him play or even just talk and have fun on a show again still has me in denial. This is the first death to really hit me this way and is a definite turning point for me as I realize in the future we'll only lose more idols and it will always be this jarring for me from here on out."

"kilmerindigo","15","Mon Jan 27 13:21:50 2020 UTC","The year was 2006, and I was in my second year of high school when my friends, Jeff and Mart, made me religiously follow the league through an unusual way: Basketball video games. During this time I was also just a casual fan of the NBA, but I knew the rules, the teams, the famous players and a little bit of history of the league. It was also our habit to play video games during our lunch break. As a kid I played a lot of games, but I never really tried sports titles before. NBA Live 06 and 07 was freshly released, and computer cafes are the thing of this time. The two of them taught me how to play the game, how the controls work, the superstar triggers, the x-factors. I even started a dynasty mode save with the awful '06 Laker team. From thereon, I was enamored with playing and watching the NBA and it's larger-than-life personalities, especially Kobe & LeBron. Jeff and Mart were both basketball junkies, sometimes we play pickup and I'd say they were good enough to be in my high school's basketball team. And here's another thing, they were also huge Kobe and Laker fans. I remember Jeff owning a Nike Zoom Huarache 2k4 in purple and white colorways, similar to what Kobe wears during games. My favorite Kobe moment during our high school years was the game winner over Boris Diaw and Raja Bell in the 2006 playoffs. This story is badly written, and it sounds like I'm just recalling my teenage years with them. And you may ask me wondering how this is related to Kobe's passing. But after I saw the news about what happened to Kobe before daybreak, it made me remember about Jeff. Last year, Jeff left the living world in a manner almost similar to Kobe. I was occupied with thoughts and the last memories of us on Mart's wedding day while trying to hold back my tears. I was also imagining what would Kobe say on his HOF speech, how we will never hear it and how the HOF committee will just induct him posthumously. How his family will accept the pain of the tragedy. Also the surreal fact that his last inteaction with the world was his last twitter and iG posts of congratulating LBJ on passing him on the all-time scoring list. Life really comes to us fast. To everyone, Learn to enjoy every minute of our lives. Make the most out of every passing day, tell your loved ones you love them. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored. R.I.P. Kobe Bean Bryant, may God put eternal rest upon your soul. MambaForever 824"
"AutomaticStop__","15","Mon Jan 27 15:32:08 2020 UTC","The Lakers haven't won a playoff series since he tore his Achilles, and now he'll never get to see them win one again. Here comes a long post that probably no one will ever read. Edit: Thank you for those that responded saying they read, means a lot right now. You are appreciated. TLDR: An overemotional mid-twenties guy recounts his not asked for memory of Kobe moments. I was born and raised in Southern California, LA County but not LA proper. I was just a youngling when the Kobe/Shaq era happened, but I still new that everyone was exciting and it was fun. I didn't know any of the basics of basketball but I loved the excitement everyone was having during that joyous time. Then the fallout happened, they lose in the finals with what was supposed to be a ""superteam"". Then Shaq gets traded. Then the allegations. It was hard not to be mad at Kobe. I was a kid and all I saw was he ran Shaq out of town. It looked like Dr. Buss backed the wrong player. But Kobe just kept going. He kept working on his game, and carrying teams that had no business being in the playoffs. His 81 point game... dude was just electrifying and so damn fun to watch. End of middle school, start of high school was his second set of championship runs. We lose to the Celtics, everything sucks. Next year we're right back in it and we win over the Magic. Then we get to Game 7 against the Celtics. It wasn't his best playoff performance but he laid it all on the line. I'll never forget Artest's post game interview but the image seared in my brain is Kobe celebrating with the crowd after the hard fought series. The final seconds he had a break away dunk, it could have been so easy to take that as a victory lap and an outlet for just pure emotion. But instead he keeps the ball in play to run out the clock and sprints over to his teammates. His final championship, if I only knew I would have savored it even more. The next year we faced the Mavericks in the conference semis. I was fortunate enough to go to Game 1 of that series. It was the first time I ever got to go see the Lakers live, a family friend took me for my birthday. That series did not end well for us but that game was amazing. I just double checked the box score of that game, Kobe put up 36 points. What I remember vividly is the final moments, Lakers are down 2. Everyone knows he's getting the ball. Kobe get's the ball, takes a three off the inbound pass as time expires. It hits the rim and bounces off, game over Lakers lose. Walking out people were mad and thought he should have tried to set up for an easier 2 point shot. I was walking out with a smile on my face, I just got to see a special player play in his habitat. A high pressure game, putting up a high amount of points, and going for the jugular, not the tie. That's who Kobe was. That's why he was my favorite player, and I wouldn't change it for the world. Next year, we get gentlemen swept out of the playoffs by the Thunder. The tides were turning, Dr. Buss was ill and everyone wanted to make one last push. We already tried to trade for Paul and that got vetoed. That offseason, we land Howard. I can't believe it, another great big man to play with Kobe! And we also got Nash?!?! It's gonna be a great year. It definitely wasn't. It looked like the Lakers weren't even going to make the playoffs with their so-called super team. But Kobe just flipped a switch. It was amazing, he was doing it all and dragging the dysfunctional team to the playoffs. He plays through a broken nose and plenty of other injuries to help keep the team winning I'll never forget him hitting unbelievable 3 after unbelievable 3 against the Raptors to snag victory out of the jaws of defeat. We were the dark horse poised to make a run at the title, a potential Lebron/Kobe finals match up was in the cards yet again. Then the game that lives in Lakers infamy happens. Against the Warriors, the Lakers couldn't afford to lose our playoff hopes were hanging on by a thread. He was doing everything yet again willing this team to victory. Before halftime, I'm not sure how many people remembered, he went down hard and was grabbing his knee. I emphatically jumped out of my chair and dropped to my knees begging the tv screen, please get up. And he did. I didn't know why I was so worried. He's invincible I reassure myself. 40 seconds left, Lakers only up by 1 season hanging in the balance and he gets fouled on a routine shot, routine foul and falls down and screams and limps weird trying to walk off pain. You could tell he was in pain. He walks up to the line and sinks both free throws to seal the game and limps off the court on his own accord. That was the last time we truly saw Kobe at the height of his game, that game is seared in my brain. The sheer will power it must have took to not only shoot and make 2 free throws on a ruptured achilles but to walk off the court by himself. I was numb, the playoffs didn't matter anymore. My hero was down and not getting back up. Howard leaves in free agency, the last 2 years had been a disaster, but it was just getting started. We become a lottery team, something Kobe was responsible for keeping away from me the majority of my life. I move out to the midwest for college. He announces he is retiring, I have to see him. I get tickets to his final game against the Pacers. 4 minutes left in the game he gets subbed in. Down 77-71. He scores the next 11 points for the Lakers in a minute and a half span, makes it 82-79 with 2:30 left. I've been to plenty of Pacers games, including playoff games for them, I've never felt Banker's Life shake like that. The thunderous KOBE chants gave me chills. He doesn't make another shot in the game, took his usual ridiculous Kobe shots but they just couldn't fall, the Lakers end up losing 87-89. Walking out my buddy who went with me was telling me he was sorry that Kobe couldn't pull it out and maybe could have got his teammates more involved at the end to get the win. I didn't want that, win or lose I wanted Kobe to play his brand of basketball. I was just so happy I got to see him play the game his way live one last time. The Lakers and Kobe together went through it all, the highs and lows of his career, the highs and lows of this storied franchise. He was the one who everyone thought of when we thought of winning basketball in LA. And he was preaching patience, our time will come again. Whenever the next championship happens, I already know I'll be crying thinking of him. Thinking of his preach for patience, when he will never be able to see it again himself. I grew up watching Kobe go from the brash 18 year old who couldn't get along with people to being the wise veteran helping to mentor the new group of young players that the Lakers were hoping could be a cornerstone. Watching his transformation, the balance of confidence in himself and humility as he recognized the end of his career. The man put everything on the line every night he played, playing through multiple injuries putting in all the extra effort to become the best he could be. It was a true inspiration and I'm lucky to say I was able to appreciate it as it was happening, no need for begrudging respect for a great player on another team. This man was on my team, and I lam so grateful. Outside of basketball, you could tell he got it. Once retirement came, he put that mamba mentality razor sharp focus on other endeavors and was willing to leave basketball behind. It showed me to leave everything you have in what you are doing in the present so you won't have regrets when it's time to move on to the next thing. I've never had a celebrity death impact me in this way. I'm not sure there ever will be another one, but can't say for sure since I wasn't expecting this one to hit this hard. Or even expecting it at all."

"AJGreenMVP","15","Mon Jan 27 18:00:06 2020 UTC","From the Middle East (Kuwait), my dad grew me up on the Lakers and I have been watching basketball since the day I was born almost. We would record the games overnight here and watch them in the mornings and when I was older my dad would wake me up at around 3 or 4 am so we could catch playoff games. I grew up on Shaq and Kobe, I’m 24 now and all my earliest basketball memories revolve around those 2. Kobe is the greatest ever Laker and spent his 20 year career with the franchise has probably been my strongest ever connection to the sport. When he retired I was in tears. So many memories of Kobe tied to my dad and my childhood. I felt like I lost a part of my dad when Kobe retired because it meant my dad was getting older. This morning I had to be at work very early (I work in construction) and my mother knew this so she checked to make sure I was awake, I had fallen asleep about an hour before the news broke. She knows my dad and I bleed purple and gold and she broke the news to me. I was in shock as I was still half asleep and immediately went on twitter and saw the outbursts of tributes and news. I started crying in bed and did not make it to work on time. I’m still in tears. I was crying at work all day. I went to the bathroom 5 times at least so nobody would see me. I started watching news coverage on youtube and just could not believe it. I still cannot believe it. Kobe can’t be gone. Kobe was more than just basketball. He was discipline, he was inspiration, he was a father, and a hero. He pushed the limits of what it meant to be human. My therapist always tells me I work too much. I always respond to my therapist with the same stories about how everyone knows who Kobe is because he slept in the gym, because he worked that much harder. I’ve had two surgeries and nothing has gotten me through the pain except thinking about Kobe and saying his name. Thinking about how much pain he played through during his career. Rest in peace to the Black Mamba, may his legacy live on through the generations. The legend will only grow from here. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bryant family as they go through this extremely difficult period. May his and his daughter’s souls rest in peace."
"Edmuresay","14","Mon Jan 27 18:02:36 2020 UTC","Started watching basketball when I was eight, first ever game I have watched was that 2008 NBA finals. Was amazed by that man in gold wearing #24. Then they go on to lose by 39. Their win the next year and their revenge the year after was the best memories of my childhood. I remember skipping the first week of school so I won't miss ANY game. (Classes start in our country in June). Kobe, like a lot of people, inspired me to pick up a ball and shoot it through a hoop. And oh how satisfying it was. Kobe introduced me to a world I'll learn to love forever. Kobe, and basketball, was my first love. I manage to achieve a few nice things in life so far, but none I celebrated more than the very first time I received a Kobe Bryant jersey. I still remember the excitement and screaming and the jumping. I wore that everywhere. None compares to the first Kobe signature shoe I ever bought. I slept at night with that beside and would stare at then proudly every single time. It sucks that I'll never get to see him ever. Kobe was more than just someone I admired because he's good at his job. It was his determination, that relentless spirit and willingness to win. The mentality together with his disposition. And just the way he carry himself. There is something about him that I wanna emulate. I patterned my life in a Kobe cut-out. I would imitate everything. The way he walks and talks, his smug and serious in game face. His celebrations and, of course, his jersey biting mannerism. He was more than a player to me, he was my hero, the father figure I never had. Kobe's death is the most impactful death of my life so far. (Not that I had many close friends and family members die already) He influenced, inspired, and motivated me more than anyone I came across with. He made me a competitor. He made me who I am today. I pray for his soul and Gianna's. I also send my regards and condolences to Vanessa and the rest of the Bryants. I cannot imagine what they're going through right now. This all too sudden. Hope they're hooping in Paradise. Rest in Peace, Kob! Mamba Forever."

"FSUnoles77","13","Mon Jan 27 16:41:16 2020 UTC","Still struggling to come to terms with this. I first got in to basketball during Magic/MJ's era. Being a fan in the UK meant limited coverage in those days. I don't recall which year it was, but I remember an ASG making it on to terrestrial TV over here and I recorded it and practically wore out the VHS. He retired about the same time I stopped playing and for a few years I didn't really follow basketball any more. Then I hear about this kid Kobe, the next MJ, and I thought ""yeah, sure, there will never be another MJ"". I finally manage to see him play on TV and I was immediately a fan for life. He was the next MJ and I could actually watch this guy ball. One of my absolute favourite sporting moments was watching Kobe take the Lakers to a 3-1 series lead over the Suns. ""Tied game!"" ""Bryant, for the win.... BANG!"" Holy shit, I will never forget watching that game, thinking to myself ""The latest episode of 24 is on, but screw that, this is insane!"". I was on holiday in 2010 when the Lakers repeated in their rematch against the Celtics. I followed the news desperate to know how that played out, and I recorded every game and watched them over 2 days when I got back. After that I signed up to NBATV to carry on watching him play as UK coverage began to lack again for a while, and tried to take in as much as I could as retirement grew ever closer and ever more likely. I had a pretty bad injury that took me off work for a long time. I was in a really low place and watching basketball, watching Kobe, was my escape. When he retired my love for the sport waned again, much like it did after MJ retired. I spent so long following and watching the sport just to watch him play that when he retired I kind of felt empty about the game. There was no one I was rooting for. I keep a keen eye on this sub and the lakers sub, and I'll watch highlight reels, but I can't seem to get excited about watching a full game like I used to, knowing that there was the possibility of Kobe doing something special. I know there are some incredible players in the league today, but that's just how I feel. To know that he is gone, and so is one of his daughters which every Lakers fan has seen growing up on the side lines, is just so incredibly sad. Can't really put it in to words how I've been feeling since hearing the news. Definitely a strong feeling of denial and grief. He was my hero, like he was to many people. His Mamba Mentality is an admirable mindset that I've tried to incorporate into aspects of my life and will make an effort to do more going forwards. His memory will live on through his family and fans everywhere. My heart bleeds for them, as well as the families of everyone else involved in this tragic accident. I'm not really sure why I'm posting this or if anyone will read it, but I had to put something in to writing somewhere to help process it. RIP Kobe"
"Immynimmy","13","Mon Jan 27 17:36:08 2020 UTC","As a Warriors fan growing up in the Bay Area, it was easy to be a Kobe hater. He always beat my team, a lot of my friends were Lakers fans even though they had never lived in LA, and his passion for the game was easy for a young adolescent to confuse as ""selfishness"", or him being a jerk. Then came the 2008 Summer Olympics. US put up a team of Lebron, Melo, DWade, Dwight, Bosh, Chris Paul, etc etc and were huge favorites to win gold. They played Spain in the finals, got up on them early, but just couldn't put them away. Watching the game at 2 in the morning or however late it was, I was starting to feel a sense of nervousness that we were actually going to lose the game. Spain just would not go away. Then in a 3-4 minute stretch in the 4th, Kobe goes bucket, assist, assist, 3 pt bucket, block, 3 pt and one bucket to effectively put Spain away. It was at that moment I realized how so many people living in the Bay Area couldn't help but be Lakers fans. This dude just makes you feel so comfortable as a viewer because you just had a feeling that if the ball was in his hands, he'd find a way. A man. A father. A model of work ethic. A philanthropist. A legend. People will be talking about Mamba forever"
"SirSmudge","15","Mon Jan 27 17:37:15 2020 UTC","I always told myself if I ever got the chance to meet Kobe, I'd simply say, ""thanks for everything."" I'm in my 30s now and that man gave me countless memories of joy and amazement that continue to inspire me today. As a Californian, we won the basketball lottery being able to watch him play every other night... it was impossible to watch this dude operate and not be inspired to be better yourself. Yo, what would Kobe do right now? In my mid 20s mamba mentality helped me pull through a dark time in my life. I was the one who got it done, but Mamba mentality was the guide and motivation that helped me along. Thanks for everything, Kobe. I love you, dude."

I've never been a huge basketball fan but yesterday made me realize just how big a Kobe fan I was. I'm still a mess but life demands moving forward. I hope his family gets all the grieving time and peace they'll need"

It's like I'm just waiting for someone to be like ""nah jk there's no way that Kobe Bryant at age 41 and his daughter at age 13 are dead"" Not gonna happen though. Fuck. This is just not gonna set in cause Kobe just seemed...invincible. We all knew that type of person he was and his mentality, you just never see him in a position of...I guess...weakness. Now I'm not saying weakness is death it's just kind of the end of the road. And with Kobe it seemed like that's something he would control. But this just reiterates that you have no control over when or how you die. Really humbling. Man just wish that he and everyone else on that ride landed safe. It's like if that one little thing happened then they would have all lived long lives. Gah it's just upsetting"

Hearing the news last night I didn't know what to think but the more time has passed by and with reading all the posts on this sub along with reading the news posts, this one is really starting to sting. We and the game have lost a legend, but his memory and the moments he gave us shall live on forever. Thank you Kobe."

"Jefffreeyyy","372","Tue Jan 28 06:03:22 2020 UTC","Honestly may have set the WNBA back 10 years. That was the future star power the league needed. Kobe was supposed to be the elder ambassador of the sport. The international impact and the intelligence he had made him a perfect candidate. Plus all the other endeavors that he had in the works I feel cheated."
"DezBaker","222","Tue Jan 28 06:45:28 2020 UTC","This is so true. She would have brought a household name that would’ve immediately piqued interest in the league, and Kobe himself was working to grow the women’s game overall. And above all that of course is a young girl who’s life was cut tragically short."

That was the first time his daughters got to see what we would call vintage Kobe, in my opinion it’s a beautiful thing they got to see their dad do what he loves at the highest level it could have been done."

I'm glad we have all been able to come together through this tragedy."
"UniqueAssUsername","134","Tue Jan 28 07:23:04 2020 UTC","Same here brother. My favorite player growing up was AI, so ever since 2001 I couldn’t stand him. He was just TOO good! Lol. Kobe was like the final boss for so many teams/fans, which is why people “hated” him. But underneath that “hate” was profound respect and admiration. I’m just glad, as I matured, I was able to appreciate his greatness."

Like you said, as I matured, I was also able to appreciate his greatness, his drive, & focus. This hit me so hard man and I'm so happy to see positive posts like these."
"BlueHundred","4","Tue Jan 28 13:53:10 2020 UTC","Me too. It was between this game and seeing if the Warriors broke the record and everybody watched this game. I grew up hating Kobe. I loved TMac and always liked him more (it's dumb how fandon makes you dislike a player because people say he's better than another player). I also hated how he always desttoyed the Knicks but everyone did so I got over it. I thought he was an inefficient shot taker and his scandal pissed me off. However, in the latter part of his career and in post retirement, he had nothing but my respect. Kobe the father and mentor was just so great. Not to mention, Kobe the businessman and creator; I was so excited to see what he would do this decade. He had a lot more to give to the sport. RIP"

"IraqouisWarGod","601","Tue Jan 28 05:20:48 2020 UTC","My 9 y.o. daughter didn’t really know Kobe before yesterday but she’s been really taken in over the past 30 hours and it’s led to to really deep convos. We’ve talked about heaven, infidelity, parenting, God’s sovereignty, basketball, coincidences, hard work, role models, helicopter safety, and so much more. I wasn’t the biggest fan of his, but I watch her watch him I can see she is just getting sucked in. I’m not sure she wouldn’t say he’s her favorite player. The toughest part was tonight as I let her watch the first quarter on ESPN. She’s getting so bummed as he starts 0/5. When he got hot and cashed that ridiculous near the end of the quarter she was so happy and then she looked up at me and said: “Daddy are you sure he’s dead?” “Yeah, baby. He’s gone” “Dad are you absolutely sure they just haven’t found them yet? Is there any way he’s still alive...”"

I remember playing 2k10 when I was his age with Kobe on the cover. Saying “Kobe” every time I threw something out at school. Thinking about his legendary work ethic when I didn’t want to work out in high school.

But seeing the video of Kobe introducing Gigi and Luka to each other broke me (if all the cutaway shots of Gigi and the family ecstatically cheering him on didn't do so already), and the tears immediately sprung into existence. The way Kobe pauses his interaction with Luka, looks over at Gigi and embraces her with one arm - pulling her closer and drawing Luka's attention to her... the love, compassion and pride he has for her was palpable, and it felt like it was radiating and bursting out of the TV screen during that gentle embrace to pierce my consciousness with a horrible truth - the truth that this divine display of the love between a father and daughter, and the deep, personal connection and understanding that the two shared beyond their family bond, had been taken away from us. In that moment, it isn't just Luka that is seeking validation and recognition from Kobe (even though Kobe has already given him that abundantly); Kobe as well wants Luka's recognition, but not for himself… In that moment he cares not for his basketball legacy, or how much the man in front of him thinks the world of him... He just wants that same man to notice and acknowledge the existence of Gigi - his true legacy, and not merely because she admires Luka, but mainly because Kobe admires her. And Gigi... I was blown away by her maturity and character; she wasn't overly or even noticeably starstruck when meeting a huge idol of hers, and was completely professional in the exchange. She's most likely received some informal publicity training/tips - I would assume by Kobe himself (he loved spending time and sharing his wisdom with her). Which makes the whole exchange and the thought of Kobe being just as invested in his daughter's life as he was in his own, and preparing Gigi for her future in almost every way possible (basketball itself, how to handle the media, countless life lessons, etc.) even more heartfelt, yet all the more heartbreaking."

Today, the road all runners come, Shoulder-high we bring you home, And set you at your threshold down, Townsman of a stiller town. Smart lad, to slip betimes away From fields where glory does not stay, And early though the laurel grows It withers quicker than the rose. Eyes the shady night has shut Cannot see the record cut, And silence sounds no worse than cheers After earth has stopped the ears. Now you will not swell the rout Of lads that wore their honours out, Runners whom renown outran And the name died before the man. So set, before its echoes fade, The fleet foot on the sill of shade, And hold to the low lintel up The still-defended challenge-cup. And round that early-laurelled head Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead, And find unwithered on its curls The garland briefer than a girl’s."

F1 still has a gaping hole where Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher existed. I’m so glad that Kobe got to acknowledge Lebron’s greatness on Friday night.

"wolfgeist","2","Tue Jan 28 07:52:29 2020 UTC","Specifically, the way he seems to gain forward momentum when he's about 1/3rd across the pool. I'm totally open to being wrong, but it looks very unnatural. I don't understand how he's able to pivot on the horizontal axis of his body without any outside support. The only explanation would be that he engages his anterior muscles, but that doesn't seem to account for the absolute shift in position while being unsuspended in air. But i'm not a physics expert by any means of the imagination."
"jama211","97","Tue Jan 28 08:27:17 2020 UTC","Someone replied and deleted their comment, this was my reply: Where is he wired though? Genuinely curious about the mechanics of it. He jumps forward and his body is vertical and then he seemingly accels forward and pivots at the midsection, rotating forward as well. The fulcrum would need to be somewhere at or above his hips (the hips would be the most obvious place for a wire based fulcrum), but to combine that with an acceleration in forward momentum would require multiple wires, which very well may be the case, but again I'm merely curious to know how it works."
"Strong-Milk","63","Tue Jan 28 07:10:34 2020 UTC","I mean, there must be some fakery going on of course, but do we know this for sure? Do you have a source that says how they did it?

I would venture a guess and say that his contract would expressly forbid him from doing things like this. And, aside from the legality/stupidity of the thing, the jump also just looks off.

They are far more than 10 inches higher than the pool and if I had to guess they're about 3 feet over the pool. 3 feet over 30 inches is 66 inches.

"iFinesseThePlug","920","Sat Feb 15 18:03:15 2020 UTC","Loved how supportive Kobe was of players who came after him. A lot of former players whine about missing the old days, but Kobe always wanted the game to thrive."
"YouCantBeSadWithADog","439","Sat Feb 15 18:04:57 2020 UTC","So passionate about the game. All he wanted to do was share his knowledge with everyone. He was like the father of the NBA."
"iFinesseThePlug","269","Sat Feb 15 18:10:24 2020 UTC","And I'm not even talking about as a teacher or mentor. Kobe wanted the game of basketball itself to succeed and inspire others. He pushed himself into the role of an active ambassador of the sport and a passive symbol for what can be achieved."
"dboti","158","Sat Feb 15 18:33:37 2020 UTC","How much his death affected fans globally really shows how much of an ambassador to the game of basketball he was."

He said when Kobe passed it was like a day of national mourning. The school he taught at held a special prayer at their assembly, and had a vigil for him in their gym. He said that the entire school attended, many people were in tears. I don’t think I know of any other American, much less American athlete, to garner that type of reaction from people in such a seemingly remote part of the world. Long Live Mamba."

"buzyb25","0","Sat Feb 15 23:43:06 2020 UTC","This is true. I both hated and loved watching Michael. But face it off the court, he only does one iota of what he can for the community and the game. Kobe was out there mentoring people of all ages. Lebron is handing out free rides to poor inner city kids in his hometown. I dont really know what MJs legacy going to be off the court, but I know it wont be as strong as the other two GOATs."
"sirenenoirette","2","Sun Feb 16 01:02:40 2020 UTC","i mean, even a cursory search online can tell you that's he's been doing lots of things for people & charities his entire career. he doesn't seem to like to publicize it, which is understandable this is a really weird practice, measuring people's humanity against each other (with often sensationalized & incorrect claims) in what ultimately amounts to an argument surrounding basketball"
"ItsGettinBreesy","117","Sat Feb 15 18:08:56 2020 UTC","It’s so crazy to think about the transformation of Kobe over the years. He went from the villain to the hero, from disliking players to being a heavy proponent of the growth in the WNBA and training players. It goes to show you how age and maturity can give you humility"
"22Savage671","7","Sun Feb 16 01:09:57 2020 UTC","I talked about it once, and that's part of the reason I love Kobe so much. He improved himself as his career passed, as you said. I hate how people like to bring up his 2003 scandal, yet people forget he was vilified by the media and lost a bunch of endorsement deals (part of the reason he is with Nike now). Most people who do bad stuff, they usually do it again in the dark. But Kobe learned from his mistakes and his experience, and I believe he really redeemed himself because he really loved his family after. Especially when he retired, he focused a lot on them willingly. Truly an amazing human being. Thank you, Kobe."
"captainhukk","13","Sat Feb 15 19:23:31 2020 UTC","A-Rod had a similar transformation in baseball. Albeit, I think Kobe's impact was much greater (especially since the NBA is a more interconnected community and affects those who use social media way more due to demographics). However, the public image perception change of both Kobe and A-rod is very similar imo. A-Rod went from being hated to beloved"
"SR3116","34","Sat Feb 15 20:09:42 2020 UTC","I really don't think is a very good comparison at all. Kobe was the villain because of his relentlessness and talent. He'd cut your heart out and was willing to sacrifice his own body to do it. A-Rod was a villain because he was a cheater and very smug about the whole thing. Also, Kobe was incredibly knowledgeable about the game of basketball and very insightful and eloquent when discussing it. A-Rod is widely considered by most baseball fans to be an unbelievably terrible announcer and is constantly meme'd for it. Thinking on it, I honestly can't come up with a solid baseball comparison for Kobe. All the generational icons of the sport are either actually assholes instead of genuinely just competitive (Bonds, A-Rod) or incredibly nice off the field (Griffey Jr, Pujols). Kobe was one of a kind."
"captainhukk","15","Sat Feb 15 20:16:27 2020 UTC","He may be a bad announcer, but if you listen to A-rod break down baseball, he's insanely knowledgeable about it, and clearly has a deep love for it just like Kobe does. A-Rod was also hated due to his arrogance and how successful he was, plus being combatative with his teammates. Idk if you remember, but when he joined the Yankees and got into fights with Jeter, it was a pretty big deal. I'm not saying they're exactly the same, but they are very similar in their overall changed perceptions. A-Rod is pretty beloved publicly now, when he was hated even as little as 5-7 years ago."
"messejueller21","11","Sat Feb 15 21:44:05 2020 UTC","Also, Kobe was incredibly knowledgeable about the game of basketball and very insightful and eloquent when discussing it. A-Rod is widely considered by most baseball fans to be an unbelievably terrible announcer and is constantly meme'd for it. That just isn't true. A-Rod is wildly knowledgeable in baseball. I'll give you the fact that he is a terrible announcer. But when he's in 1 on 1 segments, or breaking down the game..he's just as eloquent and insightful discussing it as Kobe was."
"SR3116","1","Sun Feb 16 09:03:03 2020 UTC","I'm not questioning A-Rod's baseball knowledge. He is clearly God-tier at that, amongst the greatest in the history of the game, but what I am saying is that he is an awful announcer who often misspeaks, flubs lines, forgets players names and is awful with details, which in my opinion are things that prevent one from being considered eloquent. Kobe was apparently a dude who spent time learning new languages and their proper pronunciations just to speak to other people on their level and whose writing and narration won him a goddamn Academy Award. There's a pretty big gulf between being a terrible announcer/public speaker (which you agree that A-Rod is) and being so good at communicating your thoughts and feelings that the one time you choose to do it creatively and publicly on the biggest stage possible, you win an Oscar on your first try. So it's that kind of dedication and attention to detail that I think separates Kobe from A-Rod in this regard."
"tronovich","5","Sat Feb 15 22:36:32 2020 UTC","The closest comparison would probably be Jeter? In his prime, non-Yankee fans hated Jeter...either because he was winning, or because he was doing everything he could to win. In his latter years, when his production regressed and time caught up to his body, those same non-fans started to warm up to him. In that final year, there was a lot of respect exchanged openly."
"longstairs","3","Sun Feb 16 07:30:38 2020 UTC","That’s who I’d go with as well. Played his whole career with a legendary organization and had a legendary last game on a less than great team to boot. That farewell commercial for Jeter where he gets outta the car and walks to the stadium made me tear up when I first saw it."
"Bruster10","25","Sat Feb 15 20:38:59 2020 UTC","Kobe was a villain in large part because of the sexual allegations against him in early 2000s. Not saying there wasn’t some hate there because of his talent level, but to chalk up all the negative perception he had against him early in his career to “talent and relentlessness” is 100% rewriting history"
"ipleadthefif5","0","Sat Feb 15 22:28:55 2020 UTC","Disagree. There was a lot of hate on Kobe a year or two after his drafting. He rubbed a lot of ppl the wrong way. The media didn't help with the constant Jordan comparisons. Plus he went to the Lakers, the official team of bandwagon fans. From what I remember the sexual assault case didn't really change fan perception. You either liked him or hated him regardless of the case"
"woozeeyoo","1","Sat Feb 15 18:59:39 2020 UTC","Do you think he was really widely perceived as a hero before this accident though? Not to speak ill of the dead but I feel like he was very love or hate, with a lot of people disliking him."
"LeafySeahorse","52","Sat Feb 15 19:10:20 2020 UTC","Yes. His retirement was the turning point not his death. I'm sure his death changed many minds but the tide turned at some point between his Achilles tear and his retirement - it humanized him and he did nothing but good off the court once he was done playing."
"b3x_grant","25","Sat Feb 15 19:25:49 2020 UTC","Yea. Even before this he was so much more beloved. After his Achilles tear it’s like something personality wise changed. So much more warm when interviewing, smiling much more. It’s like he got to a point where it was like “I gave this game all I had, and I’m content. Now I can just be happy”. Even his wife was saying how happy he was to just have time to be there for his kids. Just look at Kobe interviews from recent to maybe a decade or so ago and you can see the change in the man. So pissed we aren’t gonna see what else had in store for us."
"Sherwood006","9","Sat Feb 15 20:58:34 2020 UTC","I think you’re spot on with this. Especially the last part. There are very few athletes that you’re fascinated by their retirement life. The children’s books, the short film, the mamba sports academy all seemed like the tip of the iceberg for him."
"GreenYellowDucks","8","Sat Feb 15 19:05:39 2020 UTC","From my side (even as a Kings fan) he was liked. At the very least respected. But the main thing that I took note of was how he mentored a lot of the young athletes and tried to impart his wisdom on them. That was very much an eye opening piece for me, him trying to lift others up."
"HalfMan-HalfMan","9","Sat Feb 15 19:20:06 2020 UTC","Absolutely he was loved. Just look at his farewell tour. When has that ever happened in NBA or even sports?"

"EvilNinjaX24","5","Sat Feb 15 19:39:49 2020 UTC","It happened with Kareem (one team gave the man a boat!), but I don't think it happened with anyone else.

"tronovich","3","Sat Feb 15 22:38:21 2020 UTC","That was because Dirk’s plans to retire weren’t confirmed. Wade got a Kobe-like goodbye, though playing for other teams hurt that narrative. But Dirk? He definitely would’ve received the same treatment as Kobe."

"MoreWhoreLore","33","Sat Feb 15 18:24:24 2020 UTC","We dont know if it’s true, but if so it’s a lot worse than “something that happened”"
"ItsGettinBreesy","-4","Sat Feb 15 18:30:02 2020 UTC","At least it was an isolated incident, it’s not like he’s Bill Cosby or Michael Jackson or R Kelly where there’s multiple victims I really do think that 2003 Colorado incident changed Kobe’s life, I mean if you think about it after that there was really no Kobe drama for the rest of career/life (sigh)"
"weouthurr","16","Sat Feb 15 18:32:24 2020 UTC","nah kobe stayed cheating on his wife afterwards they almost got divorced in 2011 lmao I still am shocked by his death though, he began a legend through his hard work and that inspired people beyond just basketball shit"

"ccjake","1","Sat Feb 15 19:04:37 2020 UTC","Not saying he’s right, but he was a a rich young superstar in LA. It would just be too easy for him."
"ItsGettinBreesy","-3","Sat Feb 15 19:08:17 2020 UTC","Aight that’s fair - I meant like there wasn’t a string is sexual assault victims that came forth to say that they were raped by Kobe. My wording was definitely confusing so I apologize about that"
"stfu_whale","5","Sat Feb 15 19:24:45 2020 UTC","Whenever I saw him helping Celtics players, I hated it because it felt like he was helping the enemy when the Lakers were in such a sad state, but now I appreciate what he was doing. Passing down his knowledge so basketball could always move forward and evolve was a noble goal."
"grumpy_youngMan","2","Sun Feb 16 00:53:11 2020 UTC","this is my main counter-point to everyone who says 'naming an award after kobe would be reacitonary and stupid' (looking at half the people on /r/nba)... kobe literally inspired a whole generation of players, and his story is amazing enough to inspire future generations as well. there might have been better players overall (maybe a small handful), but kobe has to be top 2 or 3 in terms of how many people he's impacted. and if you think the league is better off naming awards after former league administrators / accountants / lawyers (e.g. championship trophy named after larry o'brien, league MVP named after an accountant) then i dont know what to say..."
"mainman1524","1","Sun Feb 16 00:23:06 2020 UTC","It's alot of great players who shared their knowledge but Kobe really did make it his life mission to share his knowledge with everyone. You can go on YouTube and you'll see all of these videos of Kobe sharing what motivated him and what he feels people need to hear."
"ryuhwan99","20","Sat Feb 15 18:27:23 2020 UTC","He loved the game too much. He always wanted the next generation to have the same mindset as him and even learn some of his techniques, like he did from jordan. After he retired he reached out to so many people ( young or not ) to just talk about the game , about the mentality. That's insane man, he may be gone but his impact on the game is everlasting."
"madxspence","3","Sat Feb 15 21:01:48 2020 UTC","I like sports history, so I won’t doubt that part of the game has become soft, but on the flipside, part of it has become more complicated and shifting towards more positionless players. Kobe was wonderful in the fact that he wanted the sport of basketball to succeed no matter how it changes. He was willing to share his knowledge so that basketball could be taken to an even higher level. He showed appreciation for the guys that came before, and the guys that came after and that looked up to him. Basketball lost such a great ambassador. :("
"the_caped_canuck","0","Sat Feb 15 21:09:35 2020 UTC","Let’s not pretend Kobe didn’t hate how soft/complacent some players were in this instagram generation (no judgement just saying) .

"Freakazoidberg","96","Sat Feb 15 18:18:14 2020 UTC","I've broken into tears multiple times for the past few weeks trying to put into perspective of why its effecting me like this and this is kinda how I see it. I honestly didn't think it would hit me this hard. I had his jerseys up on my wall in my room at my parents place since high school (33yrs old now). It was like a freakin shrine of the dude. My wife used to make fun of me for being such a fan boy especially since I never hero worship celebrities.. but this guy wasn't just a celebrity. He was the reason I fell in love with this game. He was my connection to this game. If you've been a fan of the NBA during the 2000s, chances are that you saw Kobe's face almost on a weekly basis for 20 years (even if you're not a Lakers fan); He was always on sportscenter or some other highlight package. He was always there. He was the embodiment of reliability. Not many things are reliable in life, but he said ""fuck that"" and showed up every night. He was the guy you could count on to put on a Hurculean effort when needed, and even sometimes when it wasn't needed. He wasn't just a connection to the game for a lot of people, he was the game. I am holding onto LeBron now to carry on that larger than life embodiment of the game."
"b3x_grant","35","Sat Feb 15 19:07:34 2020 UTC","Pretty much how I looked at it. Think about it. He came in the league at 17 and retired at what 37? We not only grew up with him but we watched him grow too. For 20 plus years he’s been all in our homes whether it’s on TV, video games, posters, phones. And it’s been great to see him grow Not just as a player but as a man. For the final few years of his career it was surreal to watch him change from this killer, to an ambassador of the game, giving back, providing us documentaries not only on his psyche basketball wise but as a man. We started seeing Kobe transition into the family man ready for his next chapter with his family where you can just tell how happy he was. And his daughter was in love with the game too and we were all gonna watch her grow and him teach her the game as well. This wasn’t just an athlete. This was an icon. On and off the court. I remember my heart dropping when I read the headline the first time. This empty feeling. I’ll never forget it. People have been saying it’ll go away over time like every celebrity but i really don’t think I’ll ever get over it. I think I’ll always just have a moment where it hits me that “man, Kobe Bryant is dead”. This is gonna hurt forever. Rest easy Bean ?"
"Freakazoidberg","10","Sat Feb 15 19:12:45 2020 UTC","You put that so much more eloquently than I could. It’s the fact that we saw a 17 yr old cocky kid grow up into a man and a father. A guy who went from having a perpetually angry scowl on his face to the warmest smile when he talks about the game and his daughters. He was in this zone that he created for himself and played in that mindset for 2 decades and he finally stepped out and opened up so much for everyone. So damn heart breaking."
"IAmNewSam","14","Sat Feb 15 19:14:01 2020 UTC","Growing up in LA without a father in mid 90's and being a big fan of basketball, I would be heavily remiss to say he wasn't an idol, a role model, and a hero all in one. The impact he had on so many people from all over the world is incredible. And that he managed to do so primarily through his love of the game of basketball makes it more inspiring. Even without ever meeting face to face, or ever talking, he taught me a lot about what it means to be a man, what it means to work hard, how you turn a dream into reality, and how you can always will a bad situation into a good one. Importnatly, he showed me what it means to grow up. We watched him go from the plucky 17 year old we saw taking brandy to prom and airballing late game shots to a guy who was reknowned as a basketball assassin, the most skilled player of his generation, a man with a will of pure steel. We watched him grow from a kid who eats McDonalds too much, to meticulously caring for his body to maximize his career length. He was a real one for sure, not many people are able to be so purely themselves and be able and ready to share that with everyone else to the extent he did. Not only that, but the pureness of his dream, despite his massive success, was also consummately special. So much so, when he described this love in the form of an animated short, it received the highest awards honors possible, an academy award. Rest in Peace Bean, you'll be missed forever."
"TheG2apist","3","Sun Feb 16 02:02:48 2020 UTC","Oof, right in the feels man. I grew up in LA without a father either and this man was the role model I looked up most to.

"IAmNewSam","13","Sat Feb 15 19:37:39 2020 UTC","He defintely didnt have to, i agree, but I was just saying that is something that he could have done and would in no way impact his standing as an owner. The bottom line is its just not something he cared to do, push the limits of basketball in other countries. I mean lets be honest MJ didn't even take as much interest in his OWN kids careers in basketball as kobe. No way in hell MJ would have offered to coach his sons team, let alone his daughters, let alone say that the kid was going to carry on his legacy lol. The quote at the top of the post is ""talent is worthless if you don't share it."" that is the talking point. MJ did not share his talent as much as kobe IDK what the argument is.

"IAmNewSam","6","Sat Feb 15 19:44:41 2020 UTC","Ya its tough because he did a lot, he really did, but i think the point is that Kobe really did go above and beyond in certain places. Really not trying to take away from MJ, he is the GOAT and without him we don't have any of this so its all important, but ya that is what i meant."
"akattom","-1","Sat Feb 15 22:39:36 2020 UTC","MJ doesn't strike me as a guy who would hold his kid's hands to follow his footsteps. They either grind for that stuff or they what they wanna do. And what the does ""sharing talents"" mean exactly? Talent is something you have or don't. It's not something you share. Just because you don't see a ton of videos on youtube about Mike schooling younger players, you can't immediately assume that he held his shit back. None of us can know that."
"IAmNewSam","1","Sat Feb 15 22:46:47 2020 UTC","Sharing talent to me is another way of giving back. Now, of course MJ did and does give back in his own way, but he did not go and basically develop a basketball infrastructure and understanding in a compeltely different country and culture just because he loved basketball. He just didn't do it. Again I've said this numerous times by now, its not an indictment, but more so a point of praise for kobe because he truly went above and beyond his duty as an athelete. He truly became a basketball ambassador and an international mind for the game. MJ is and will be a baksetball icon, there is no question, but when you ask yourself if he did things like that the answer is just no. For kobe to go and do things like call out and make goals for players like giannis and westbrook when he is retired, (aka like win mvp for giannis and the next season he did) constantly offering post clinics to any calibre player that would ask. taking is daughter, a growing basketball player, to meet her favorite athlete in the NBA and developing a relationship. I mean on his farewell tour, kobe went out of his way to make sure he did things like tell Wade to bring his kids because he knew before he announced his retirement that it was going to be his last game in Miami. After that game he talked to the kids, let them get to know him, and gave them advice and shoes, but most importantly he didnt let his status as a basketball icon stop him from connecting in a very human way. again no indictment on jordan, these are things that no one HAS to do, but the fact is kobe did them because it mattered to him and for that he has my respect. and for the record kobe wasn't holding giannas hand, that is some really disrepectful shit to say lol she worked extremely hard. she was just utilizing all the experience from her father as any child would, the fact her father was kobe doesn't really change that. If anything it highlights how much it meant to kobe to be a good father and to be there for his children and to take an active role in their growing up. hard to fault that."

Imagine if Jordan was a baseball player instead. Can you imagine Kobe Bryant's game being the same? Nike might've died without Jordan. Kobe might not even have his logo, or his sneakers. Kobe would even have the same mannerisms. Kobe wouldn't be the Kobe you know with out Jordan.

"Geoff_Uckersilf","0","Sat Feb 15 21:08:01 2020 UTC","There is no doubt that Giannis is a phenom, I only consider that players in the west are in a constant arm wrestle compared to the east.

"throwaway_5256","2","Sat Feb 15 21:20:25 2020 UTC","What how did Stockton carry his team to the brink. He was at best 1b on his team and Malone was clearly better in their Finals runs. Also there's stuff that adjusts for strength of schedule which also shows the Bucks are great, and while Giannis clearly has a better supporting cast it's not like Dame is in a wasteland. At least not enough to tilt him over Giannis' team getting potentially 25 more wins. Even if you ignore team cast Giannis is a far better two way player and his worse shooting is made up by how his slashing creates open 3s and how good he is in the paint"

It is baffling that you think Malone would be less than half the player when Malone was just as beneficial to pumping up Stockton's assists numbers as Stockton was to Malone's scoring. Not to mention Malone was a beast in the post and it doesn't exactly require an all timer to throw a good entry pass. Not as great, sure, less than half? Ridiculous overexaggeration. Watch the tape of the 96 WCF and see how Gary Payton absolutely obliterated Stockton and then look at the 98 Finals where he averaged 10/8. There is no other player in NBA history that would be a co-headliner for a Finals team with such a meager statline besides Stockton. Nobody calls them the Dirk/Terry Mavs yet Terry posted similar offensive output to Stockton at 18/3, was more efficient, hit several clutch shots, and actually was on the winning team. Malone was the guy who took that team to the 98 Finals and any idea that Stockton ""dragged them to the brink"" is not based in reality."

"Spartinini","7","Sat Feb 15 19:45:21 2020 UTC","Thats why he put that, Russ only won his MVP because he averaged a triple double when it the idea seemed ludacris. Now averaging a triple double isnt all that special but at the time it was."
"somethingtolose","4","Sat Feb 15 20:06:59 2020 UTC","Its still very special, Russ is aan anomaly, and somehow still underrated. Dame is underrated too for what it's worth, but Portland's record is far too bad for mvp consideration."

"MDequation","223","Sat Feb 15 17:05:19 2020 UTC","I feel the same. Kobe was one of the few to open up and share his life philosophy with the public. He literally made you feel that you too can accomplish what you want even if the odds are stack against you. He was/is still a great role model. It is still tough even though it's been sometime."
"cherryripeswhore","40","Sat Feb 15 18:43:52 2020 UTC","I bought his book (The Mamba Mentality) over a year ago, but I've read it more times in the last 20 days than I have the whole year. Highly recommend anyone to get it if you like his artistic style and wanna be inspired."

"cherryripeswhore","21","Sat Feb 15 19:15:37 2020 UTC","That was an amazing part for sure. My favourite bit is when he's talking about how he's defending AI in the Finals - counting out the seconds for how long it takes him to make his move and using that information to disrupt him as the series wears on.. Some things you just don't think about when playing until Kobe expresses it, just incredible."
"DefrancoAce222","9","Sat Feb 15 21:16:41 2020 UTC","One thing I love about his philosophy is that it can be applied to any goal. The Mamba Mentality can be used trying to kick ass in college, at work, side projects, training, and even your personal life. It’s even the small things like sleeping and meditating that he always talked about that can make a big impact in one’s life. He’ll never be considered just a ball player. He was a visionary."
"schumonsta","9","Sat Feb 15 22:00:17 2020 UTC","I attribute many of my successes in life to the mamba mentality. Growing up in LA and watching every game, listening to Stu Lantz, and watching all pre&post games just made me idolize Kobe. I literally felt that anything was possible. I was homeless for a while, dropped out of high school to work full-time at 15 and support my family, but I wanted to graduate college still one day. I forced myself to get a GED, then community college, followed by uni, and I have my dream job working fully remote. I did the work, but I was so inspired by Kobe. We weren’t ready to lose him. He had so much more to teach. “The good die young” rest in piece, mamba."
"DefrancoAce222","3","Sun Feb 16 03:29:50 2020 UTC","I feel that bro. Think the best thing many of us can do to honor him is to apply his mentality to our own lives. That why his philosophy lives in many. Congrats on your success!"
"TheQnology","54","Sat Feb 15 17:20:45 2020 UTC","To be clear: he wasn't just a hero. He was not somebody you just admired. To me, at least, he was that person who you thought about when I was pulling overtimes, he was me working hard for my company that I barely know, he was me giving it my all when I thought I had nothing left to give, he was that, not a hero, but somebody I could be more of in my life."

"2nd2last","8","Sat Feb 15 17:02:03 2020 UTC","What do you mean by his life was a philosophy?"
"TheQnology","47","Sat Feb 15 17:06:44 2020 UTC","The work he embodied, one can only ponder what goes through his mind. When he is the first person to wake up, and the last person to fall asleep. You start thinking ""but basketball is easy, life is harder.."" but then you know deep down it's never easy, or hard, it's about what you give to it, how much you can. That thing that nags you, when he speaks, he wasn't talking about basketball, but life in general."
"2nd2last","-9","Sat Feb 15 17:16:33 2020 UTC","Not to diminish him, but couldn't you say that most successful athletes and people live by their own personality philosophy?"
"TheQnology","11","Sat Feb 15 17:26:43 2020 UTC","Not really, because the things he said, it resonates, not because of basketball, but of hardwork, one that I could use more of, in my life. His personality philosophy, should be everybody's.. and I think that's the fucking point. We could all use a bit of Kobe."
"2nd2last","-14","Sat Feb 15 17:44:48 2020 UTC","Kobe definitely walked the talk, but how is he different from say Shaq who I'd say enjoying success and personal relationships. Or Duncan who worked incredibly hard, while being considered a good friend and teammate while being very quiet spoken and humble. Its strange to suggest Kobe's philosophy was one, unique for even existing, 2, he was unique for following his own philosophy, 3, thinking it's the only way to achieve success, 4, thinking everyone should follow it."
"duhpolan","3","Sat Feb 15 17:59:33 2020 UTC","Because he's very outspoken about it and if finds someone ""worthy"" (I know that's kinda corny, he was corny lol) he will mentor them. How many ppl you think go to Tim Duncan for advice. Maybe his circle, but Kobe would help out the kids of tomorrow. Hell, he even had the camp for girls to achieve more than any WNBA player has achieved before. Then there's his desire for more. He wanted an Oscar, he got it. He wanted to do business, he actively invested and increased his earnings. He wanted to be a great father and seemingly all accounts he was. It's the public side and willingness to make others great too that's Giannis is talking about. You think the young guns go to Shaq to learn how to be great? Or to Duncan?"
"jagarzlatan","7","Sat Feb 15 17:55:41 2020 UTC","Shaqs philosophy of not practicing or staying in shape because he was the most physically dominant player? Crazy it almost seems like you paint a picture of some folks being successful DESPITE their personal philosophy. Of all ‘professionals’ to pick you choose someone who’s work ethic literally stopped them from becoming the potential GOAT. Appreciate the laugh as you try and cut down the guys point about Kobe. If Shaq would have followed Kobe’s philosophy strictly related to basketball and learned to shoot from the strip good lord. Strange to suggest indeed lol."
"2nd2last","0","Sat Feb 15 18:11:40 2020 UTC","If you limit success to only business then maybe you have a point, but as hard as it is to separate our love of someone for playing a game and the game itself, its important to some to understand that there is more. Hell, you could also argue that Kobe's killer, no friends mentally fractured the relationship and cost them titles."
"jagarzlatan","6","Sat Feb 15 18:25:31 2020 UTC","I don’t think his no friends mentality can be blamed for fracturing the relationship they’ve been so open about what went wrong? The fracture of Shaq and Kobe is literally the same thing I posted above. Kobe gave Shaq tons of shit as their threepeat closed for not practicing/maintaining shape in the off-season. Leading up to the trade Shaq was legit saying his body got too banged up from hack a Shaq and he couldn’t practice? Not even free throws, the result of said hack a shaq. I just don’t care for this history revisionism that Kobe’s work ethic and drive is what ran Shaq out of LA. It was Shaqs complete lack of all of the above. He was the most physically dominant player and that was not going to change from 99-04 whether he practiced or dieted or not. He was satisfied with being as good as he was, simply put. You can attempt to change history all you want to fit your narrative that Kobe’s philosophy is nothing special and other people have been successful with their own way, but you picked possibly the worst example ever to hammer that point home. Notice I didn’t have a word to say about Duncan. Duncan is a great example of somebody who paved their own way, but he also had Pop playing the role of Kobe for the spurs, let’s not just leave that out. Kobe would have shot free throws underhanded if it would have propelled him to the next level. Kobe was not the problem you just whiffed really badly in this take man I’m sorry."
"2nd2last","0","Sat Feb 15 18:36:38 2020 UTC","My Shaq example is to show someone not valuing NBA success as highly as others. He valued life, right or wrong, more. Kobe's philosophy was certainly not, not special. It is a great roadmap to great business and personal success and can work for many. You act like Shaq is a bum because he didn't win as much as he should/could have. Yes, Kobe disliked Shaq's appearance and it splintered the relationship. But also, Kobe could have accepted it and potentially won a few more. My argument is, Kobe was not unique in having or living a philosophy, and saying his is the best or the best for everyone is wrong."
"RedOne98","4","Sat Feb 15 17:57:07 2020 UTC","Well its very different from someone like Shaq, nkt to take away from Shaq, but he wasn't that hard of a worker, where on the other hand, one could argue a less gifted kobe ( in comparison to Shaq) managed to get on his level with extreme hard work and dedication that most of people wouldn't be able to go through"
"2nd2last","0","Sat Feb 15 18:01:52 2020 UTC","For sure, but some could argue success isn't limited to NBA or business goals, but personal relationships as well. And to some, Shaq has a better work to life balance and that might be more important. Again, not trying to diminish Kobe, but others have and live their philosophy and others might like, need, and respect Shaq's more."
"CutLonzosHair2017","1","Sat Feb 15 17:57:38 2020 UTC","Because he preached it. He taught it. He was a walking self-help book."

"ShadowClawz","24","Sat Feb 15 17:12:58 2020 UTC","Mamba mentality is literally a modern day philosophical take that values work ethic and the ability to surpass your limits in order to win. Dude was the first guy in last guy out in the gym, quite the superhuman as he only sleeps 4 hours a day, didn't give two shits about ""load management"". However, mamba mentality is focused solely on the individual but yeah that's how it works."

"AoE2manatarms","20","Thu Jan 30 02:51:49 2020 UTC","Thank you for posting this! It’s baffling to see people calling him a rapist, there is so much fucking evidence (and lack thereof by the prosecutor) saying that the claim was bullshit."
"[deleted]","7","Thu Jan 30 11:29:15 2020 UTC","The thing thats the most fishy honestly is Kobe's apology. He admits that he understands it wasn't consensual. That's rape fam."
"SerenadeSwift","4","Thu Jan 30 14:29:33 2020 UTC","The thing that is most disappointing about all of this is how easily everyone bandwagons the 'nuts and sluts' defense, and latches on to hearsay from fanbois about what the accuser allegedly said in an effort to discredit her. ""vaginal trauma can happen in consensual sex!"" Yes, it can. But if you think this is so common that it is exculpatory, you're either grasping at straws or you have no experience from which to draw on. Kobe left the encounter with her blood on his shirt. Raise your hand if that's ever happened to you (not during shark week). ""there was no DNA from a previous encounter on Kobe"" Real life isn't fucking CSI. DNA evidence in real life is very hard to come by, and often unreliable. The rest is just hearsay from Kobe stans slandering the accuser calling her crazy or a slut. I don't know if Kobe raped that girl, and I really have no dog in the fight. But the response to it by the general public tells me we didn't make a whiff of progress with the Me Too movement. Not one single fucking bit. If you like Kobe, she's a nutty slut and everyone who slandered her is reliable. She gave up her case not because an army of fanbois was threatening her life, no sir, it was because there was ""no evidence or testimony"" (because apparently the accusers testimony somehow doesn't count). It's a sad state of affairs how little we've progressed on this issue, and the next girl who gets raped by a celebrity is even more likely to be scared to come forward."
"Oakroscoe","2","Thu Jan 30 15:35:54 2020 UTC","The accuser changed her story 3 times and refused to testify, that’s why her testimony didn’t work in court."
"ChocolateMorsels","1","Thu Jan 30 14:23:11 2020 UTC","Did you actually read the apology. He said he believed that it was consensual and now realizes that she didn’t see it as that. The apology was required as part of the settlement."
"AoE2manatarms","1","Thu Jan 30 15:18:24 2020 UTC","This is only a take you can have if you think these public statements have any truth to them and aren't created to fit the lawyers preferred narrative. Kobe didn't write those words and they aren't his true feelings. And did you read the link? Like the other dude says, when you read the details of the case I don't see how you choose any side except Kobe's. The woman's friend wanted to testify against her. Everyone has their bias' though. To substantiate this, the accuser asked for ""unspecified amount of money, as well as public vindication."". She got both in the settlement. The accuser is the one who wanted this comment."
"Negrodamuswuzhere","1","Thu Jan 30 15:22:58 2020 UTC","I feel like this article of his apology gives a good amount of detail as well. This is the apology he mentions will not be used in or was used in any trial/case Apology"

"Bayou-Maharaja","3","Thu Jan 30 05:27:30 2020 UTC","What bugs met the most is people who may or may not have read the facts (lets be realistic they probably didn't) are just outright calling him a rapist.

"daddydunc","18","Thu Jan 30 05:49:14 2020 UTC","From his apology: Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did.

He’s also irrelevant to the NFL (correct me if I’m wrong, maybe he’s done some stuff with NFL i don’t know about) he’s just a much bigger star. Why don’t they honor every big sports star who dies too young? I’m not trying to be controversial here, again I really do hope they do Kobe right, but if you’re going to say that one is irrelevant to the NFL then you have to say so is the other, no? The biggest differences being 1) who knows the name aka Kobe is a worldwide name and 2) Kobe played sports Also, that episode of Spongebob came out a while ago (on mobile so not sure what year..) when I was a young kid and I’m now 22, so I’m not sure I’d say it was teenagers who threw the biggest tantrums. I don’t think they did anything wrong with the tribute last year FYI, I just think it was a lot of mid 20 year olds who got more upset that they’re meme didn’t happen"

I stumbled upon this after the sports shows and news on Italian TV dedicated a lot of time to him and brought up his background.

No idea what position though (funnily enough the US already had a ""Kobe"" in Cobi Jones)."
"ghostfivenine","52","Mon Jan 27 02:53:53 2020 UTC","What a horrible tragedy.

The sports world lost a truly legendary competitor. Surreal. I'm not a Lakers fan, but often catch myself saying Kobe while making a shot of any kind. Literally dropped a Kobe yesterday while scoring a goal in Rocket League. Like, how many other athletes have had their name etched into everyday vocabulary?"

I didn’t like Kobe very much because whenever he’d play my team, the Pistons, he would just go off....I hated him but man I still loved watching him play and I will always have a mad level of respect for how he played and what he meant for the sport as a whole. He was a stone cold killer on the court. Boy, in the fourth quarter when he got that look in his eye and started going off, yup, that was it, lights out, you were done. I don’t know how many baseball fans are here but a similar athlete for me was the great Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. God, whenever I heard “ Enter Sandman” (his walking onto the field song), and saw him trotting in from the outfield, fuck, I knew our team was fucked. That was how I felt seeing Kobe closing out games against my teams, lol. Kobe was a very interesting person. He wasn’t a stereotypical US athlete. He was fluent in Italian and Spanish, loved The Beautiful Game, and transcended sports, really. RIP Black Mamba.

"djokov","34","Mon Jan 27 10:18:43 2020 UTC","Kobe 100% knew what he was doing. One of he few ways to pacify a player who is much better than you is to unsettle him by playing rough. Kobe played into the fact that Barnes was attempting to do this and deliberately set himself up for the fouls to happen. His completely unfazed demeanour served to fuel Barnes' aggression and frustration levels. To me that's not unsporting, it's just smart. At the end of the day the fouls are still fouls. Avoiding them often leads to the fouls not being called as well."

"Santos_L_Halper","3","Mon Jan 27 17:21:24 2020 UTC","As others said - Kobe was baiting him. Barnes is a known hot-head and will do dirty shit. Kobe did enough within the rules of the game to bait Barnes in to reacting. All that contact Kobe was doing was perfectly legal but perhaps a bit stiff. Even the elbow he raised. As a dunker you aren't allowed to swing on the rim. Watch Barnes' angle of attack on the rim, he easily could have dropped straight down with no lateral motion. Instead, he swung his hips and made contact with Kobe. At that point he was trying to bait Kobe in to reacting but as Mike Breen said in the broadcast - you aren't going to get in to Kobe's head. There was no foul called on either of them in this exchange, which is the right call because it was just posturing, but Howard chirped at the ref and probably used vulgarity which is a tech 100% of the time. But anyway - I'm a Celtics fan and at this time would talk shit on Kobe every chance I got but Barnes was definitely at fault for all of this."
"bananosecond","2","Mon Jan 27 12:52:07 2020 UTC","A but, but all pretty minor I think. The elbow after the dunk to me just looks like it's to protect himself from getting landed on. Noting too aggressive really."
"boriswied","4","Mon Jan 27 11:52:22 2020 UTC","He doesn't ""elbow him"". He protects himself from the impact of Barnes, as he's diving towards him. He did kinda needlessly push him in the abdomen right before that though. All of this is a non issue though, it's all well within the normal mental fight in the game. I remember my little brother, who is the most docile guy ever in normal life, would do the most horrid things on the court. We'd always see some opponent very suddenly get super angry with him, with nothing being seen before. One time a guy took a swing at him out of nowhere and the ref immediately threw that guy out. The dude then runs at the judge throwing off his shirt, and underneath he was red in a long line all the way up his side, bleeding a little bit in one place. My brother had perfected the art of pinching peoples sides really hard when fighting in the paint, which is basically invisible to the ref. He genuinely didn't understand the guy was angry and tried to apologize to him after the game saying ""i thought we where just playing"". Ofc that's much worse that what happened here, but i offer it just to say this: depending on the sporting environment you train in, you just get a standard for what's really ""allowed"". And it definitely isn't from the rulebook of the sport you're playing - it's expected to take into consideration what refs see and maximize advantage under those circumstances."
"Superhuzza","1","Mon Jan 27 20:52:49 2020 UTC","lol what, pinching people in basketball is a dick move. Way different than putting some back into a defense"
"veganveal","1","Mon Jan 27 11:30:12 2020 UTC","Hell yeah. Sports at the professional level involves intimidating your opponent. No one was going to intimidate Kobe."
"witz0r","1","Mon Jan 27 11:35:12 2020 UTC","Kobe was being passive aggressive because he knew it would get his opponent in the wrong place mentally. He did this often, but a lot of the great ones did this. If they saw their opponent as mentally weak, they’d exploit it. Jordan made a career of it. Hell, that’s who Kobe learned it from."

"h723456","9","Mon Jan 27 16:03:30 2020 UTC","Actually this whole debate of whether the ball was near his face was debunked because the initial overhead screenshot was misleading and didn’t show Barnes fully extending his arms. In that misleading screenshot he was still holding the ball close to himself. In the overhead video, you can clearly see the ball get really close to Kobe’s face. Not to mention that Matt Barnes himself responded to this debate and said he 100% did fake the ball right to Kobe’s face and called this whole debate “dead”."

If I had to speculate tho Kobe knew he wouldn't do it (as said above) and for sure knew he couldn't let someone like Barnes make him flinch. Kobe knew he either had to get hit by the ball or call the bluff. Man was a fucking legend and will forever be remembered as such by me."
"extremeskater619","16","Mon Jan 27 06:43:07 2020 UTC","No but like, it was so fast he wouldn't have been able to think about it. His lizard brain would have been thinking ""you're about to be hit in the face, close your eyes"" before he had a chance to actually react.

It's exactly like what he does the other two times he gets fouled in the OP clip: shift weight to left foot, look away to the right, stay calm. Only difference between the other two times and the fake pass is with the first two fouls the aggression persisted long enough for him to slowly put his hands up into the air."

"wattatime","7","Mon Jan 27 07:44:10 2020 UTC","I think the trick is honestly that Barnes didn't break his wrists. If you want someone to flinch you break your wrist in the throw but you don't release. This is what you normally do when you pass, so if your brain doesn't see it it just triggers the motion as moving the ball around and not as a pass. Me and my brother would mess with each other all the time doing fake and not fake passes, the break was always the key and was insanely hard not to react to, even if you knew it would never happen."

"Rocko210","5","Sun Jan 26 22:33:06 2020 UTC","Oddly, they're pretty safe with how they look. Even if there's a total engine failure, with enough altitude the pilots can use something called autorotation to generate enough lift at the last second to hopefully land gently. If the initial reports of a fire are true, I would guess smoke might have overtaken everyone before they could get safely to the ground, or the distraction caused them to crash. It's definitely terrible whatever the cause."

"MooseBayou","378","Sun Jan 26 23:01:59 2020 UTC","The difference is that when Magic announced his status, we were still in the early years where a diagnosis = death sentence. ETA: for reference. Magic made his announcement 11-7-91. Freddy Mercury died of AIDS 11-24-91. 14 days later. Freddy was very private about his fate and secluded himself in his final days. HIV AIDS had a huge stigma against it then. It was a “gay disease”. Some morons thought it was a plague God sent to punish gays for their sins. So when an obviously heterosexual man - a husband, a father, one of the greatest ball players who ever lived announced he had what was considered a lethal disease, we were shocked. And believed he’d be dead within a year. Mercury had money, but it couldn’t save his life. Magic had money and was lucky enough to be able to try the emerging suppressive drug cocktails. ETA 2: to better understand the cultural reaction to the emerging AIDS epidemic, I highly recommend “How to Survive a Plague.” It shows how the conservative politicians kept possibly life-saving treatments from dying Americans."

A man you will never know will always be around you in vivid detail and you can't touch him. Constant tributes every time the Lakers go to the playoffs. Everyone you meet will have a story about your dad that you will have to listen too. Most people get a few family movies and various stories from others, but the memory starts to fade. Your Dad can become who ever you need him to be in order to live your life. Kobe will always be Kobe to her and she will always be confronted with what if? Why didn't I know him? Doesn't invalidate your thought, but just another perspective that hit me."

His daughter will have a better idea of her father then most that lose theirs do. Hundreds of hours of interviews, and a huge community of his peers that will guide and support her as she grows up. This is an absolutely horrible tragedy, but she's luckier than most in her position. She'll have a hundred father figures as she grows into a woman."

"Akkuron","8","Thu Jan 30 21:24:06 2020 UTC","Lol, it's not gonna ruin anything. They'll play 3 individual 12 minute games with 100k prize for each, then add their total points and play a last quarter with the clock off until someone hits a target score.

"ThisIsMy5thAcc","2","Thu Jan 30 21:13:56 2020 UTC","It's not confusing. It's somewhere between confusing and frustrating. Like I don't know what we, the fans, gain from this. It's for charity? Cool.

"OhEmGeeBasedGod","3","Thu Jan 30 20:41:06 2020 UTC","It's really simple. It's like golf, where you add up the score for each day to get your aggregate score. Then you add 24 points to whoever has the highest score through three quarters and whoever reaches that number first wins. If it's 120-110 after 3 quarters, the first team to get 144 points wins."

"bmoneywateryeyes","2","Thu Jan 30 22:19:35 2020 UTC","Right! The East outscoring the West really threw me off."
"raidennugyen","2","Thu Jan 30 23:57:44 2020 UTC","It allows multiple charities for likely varying reasons to get something out of the game... The result is kind of nice even thought the route to that result is clunky as fuck lol.... I think the easier route would be just split the charity pool by the % of scoring East: 108 West: 140 248 total points East Charity: = 43.54 % of the pool ($217,700) West Charity: = 56.45% of the pool ($282,250) OR... Maybe cut out a guaranteed amount for the winner then split the rest based on points... so the overall winner gets $250,000, then they split the remaining $250,000 based on points scored (the same as above) East Charity: = 43.54 % of the split pool ($108,850) West Charity: = $250,000 + 56.45% of the split pool ($141,125) EC total: $108,850 WC total: $391,125 This could net a similar effect... with less of a ""what the fuck is going on"" impact to the people simply watching the game.

"Bill_Ender_Belichick","2","Thu Jan 30 20:02:00 2020 UTC","I think this format is way better. It keeps both teams competing for all four quarters, and we might even see some defense (assuming the players care about winning money for their charity)."

"LarBrd33","4","Thu Jan 30 23:27:21 2020 UTC","Exactly. We can all just think of it as them showing us the quarterly scores all game, until the 4th. It's not actually resetting. It's just the way they choose to word it. It's honestly nothing more than a ""UI"" issue."
"helmetsmusic","41","Thu Jan 30 23:04:50 2020 UTC","The way it's been written is still confusing. Bottom line... Your points count through 3 quarters just like any other game. Big difference is that at the start of the 4th quarter, whichever team is in the lead - the target score becomes their total points + 24. We've seen this type of format before and it's really fucking fun, because it turns every game into an exciting finish where the final shot is always a game winner. Perfect idea to add some excitement to the all-star game. Example: If the East is up 112 to 106 after 3 quarters... the target score becomes 136 (112 + 24). Whichever team gets to 136 first wins. Beyond that, whoever scores the most each quarter wins money for their charity. Nothing gets ""reset""... Wording is confusing people."

"SerenadeSwift","5","Thu Jan 30 19:49:49 2020 UTC","For example: Quarter 1 East - 32, West - 28 Quarter 2 East - 25, West 27 Total score after 2nd Quarter: East - 57, West - 55 In this example, even though East leads at halftime, West's charity receives the $100,000 for Quarter 2 because they outscored East by 2 in the quarter. Perhaps to the casual fan it's easier to visualize with the reset, but I agree it should have been billed as ""Win the quarter"" without a confusing reset."

"KentaviusCaldwelPoop","2","Thu Jan 30 19:50:44 2020 UTC","Being as close in the game as possible so that winning the game overall will be much more significant. Say if West win all 3 quarters by a combined 15 points. That means East would have to score 39 points in the 4th before the West scores 24. The only issue I have with this is the cap being at 24. Should be at 32 (24+8) so that if the winning team gets hot or something, the 4th quarter doesn't end 5 minutes in lol. I think it will increase competitiveness in the earlier quarters, which I'm sure is NBA's intentions after years of complaints of the non-competitiveness."
"OhEmGeeBasedGod","2","Thu Jan 30 20:06:15 2020 UTC","I would assume it's because winning total points has more bonuses than winning each quarter. It's supposed to make it 'exciting' by making winning less predictable by just going off of total points."

"vy2005","4","Thu Jan 30 19:59:18 2020 UTC","The format is a modified Elam ending. I personally hope the NBA adopts it as a format in the future. Current basketball end game is dumb as hell. Elam’s goal was simple – to try to create an endgame sequence where basketball actually looks like basketball instead of watching one team walk up the floor to shoot free throws and another team race down the floor to jack up threes. The Elam Ending accomplishes that mission because trailing teams who would dare to commit intentional fouls would be gifting their opponents an easy victory. Instead, they are required to play tight defense (as they would for the rest of the game) and try to get stops while scoring at the other end. One of the best examples for the benefits of the Elam Ending came in the game between the Scarlet and Gray (Ohio State alumni) and the Matadores (Texas Tech). The Ohio State team held a 75-70 lead when the Elam Ending began. With a target score of 82, the Scarlet and Gray led 80-73. The game ended with an alley-oop dunk that brought the entire gym in Columbus to their feet. Now here is the relevant question for sports fans – would you rather watch a game-winning, walk-off alley-oop… or would you rather watch the Matadores foul on four or five possessions in a nearly hopeless, time-consuming waste of everybody’s time? I would be willing to wager that at least 99% of fans would prefer the first scenario, unless there is someone out there who just really, really enjoys the art of the intentional foul. With the Elam Ending, every single game is guaranteed a game winning shot https://thecomeback.com/nba/the-elam-ending-is-the-best-thing-to-happen-to-basketball-this-century.html"
"BillyPotion","7","Thu Jan 30 20:10:44 2020 UTC","I've never heard of the Elam Ending before and didn't know it was a thing. Thanks for the article. Personally, I'm glad the NBA is following the NFL's lead and trying out different wacky rules for the All-star game, like the 4th and 15 onside in the Pro-Bowl this year. This sounds like a fun concept so it'll be interesting to watch how it plays out with NBA players."
"CWSwapigans","7","Thu Jan 30 22:48:30 2020 UTC","Hopefully the 4th and 15 onside will be adopted in regular games. The onside has been completely neutered"

"lulu314","4","Thu Jan 30 22:22:29 2020 UTC","Buzzer beaters are bad ass but really rare statistically. Having a game-winning shot 100% of the time seems like a big net win. And some of those shots will feel about as tense as a true buzzer beater."
"ThatNewSockFeel","19","Thu Jan 30 22:31:34 2020 UTC","But rare is why it’s great. If it happens all the time it’s less impactful. Not to say this system won’t ever make for great endings, but personally it would be a big loss never having buzzer beaters"

"CWSwapigans","3","Thu Jan 30 21:21:45 2020 UTC","– The Elam Ending is made for television. Are you kidding me? Instead of the endless parade of fouls and timeouts and stoppages, the Elam Ending creates a natural conclusion to every game that draws viewers and fans alike in. Amidst an endless array of stoppages in games now, it’s easy to change the channel or lose interest. If you do that during the Elam Ending at any moment, you risk missing the end of the game. Every broadcast partner of the NBA and college basketball should be calling the powers that be now and demanding its implementation. I personally agree the Elam Ending would produce better endgames about 90% of the time, but the above quote is exactly why the NBA will never go for it. The timeouts, stoppages, etc. are perfect places for ads and the end of games are when the most people are tuned in. The NBA and the networks would never give up that revenue."
"ToxicSteve13","3","Thu Jan 30 22:52:37 2020 UTC","They're not showing ads during free throws though are they? Time outs would still be relevant with this format. In fact, with the time saved with less free throws, it's possible they can add another timeout completely."
"CWSwapigans","3","Thu Jan 30 22:20:33 2020 UTC","I don’t know, I’d be interested to see the numbers. Watchability is worth a lot.

Is that the case?"
"zarvinny","6","Thu Jan 30 23:19:45 2020 UTC","Certainly happens for a Wednesday night Cleveland Detroit game since they ""run out"" but the national games have contracts that allow them to play more commercials with a different (usually cheaper) rate if they go over a certain number"

To win the NBA All-Star Game, the team with 100 points would need to score 24 points in the fourth quarter before the team with 95 points scores 29 points, and vice versa.

Then Q2 ends 35-30 East, East charity gets $100k, scorekeepers say, okay, total score is 80-70 East, now start Q3. Then Q3 ends 55-50 West, West charity gets $100k, scorekeepers say, okay, total score is 130-125 East, now the ""finish line"" is 154 (i.e., 130+24) so first team to 154 wins.

There’s at least $500,000 for charity at stake from the game alone. Each of the first three quarters is worth $100,000 — if there’s a tie, the money rolls over to the next quarter — and the final score is worth another $200,000.

"Neoxyte","622","Sat Feb 1 03:21:56 2020 UTC","The insurance company is the one who's going to be footing the bill anyway. Though I wonder if there will be criminal negligence complaints against the company or management. EDIT: for those saying the insurance policy won't cover anything because the pilot was flying wrecklessly because he want certified, it doesn't matter. Just like liability insurance protects you if you're sued when you're in a negligent accident while driving, the helicopter company is also protected In a civil suit. Check this link out for more information: https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/dui-related-accidents-and-car-insurance.html"
"Two_Luffas","561","Sat Feb 1 03:58:31 2020 UTC","The insurance company is the one who's going to be footing the bill anyway. Most likely not, since as they understood it they were insuring a company that wasn't allowed to fly in bad weather. If the company did have a license to fly in bad weather their insurance company would have undoubtedly charged them much higher premiums for that ability. This happens all the time in many industries. Insurance companies are very strict about the understanding of what you are and aren't covered for and if something bad happens that you shouldn't have been doing, you're not covered. The insurance company will most likely fight very hard against having to pay out any damages because they most likely had a clause in the insurance paperwork that relieves them of coverage if they fly in bad weather. Edit: Of course it depends what is the definition of 'bad weather' in a professional aviation sense. That doesn't seem hard to argue to me but I'm not I the industry so that will be argued by plenty of professionals and lawyers."
"foreverkasai","82","Sat Feb 1 04:27:17 2020 UTC","I haven't had a chance to look at the exact weather circumstances but the NTSB is going to fully delve into what exactly the weather was in their report. Weather in aviation can vary greatly moment to moment but considering the overall conditions it suggests pilot error and fault. I don't fly helicopters so I'm not exactly sure how their rules operate compared to planes, but attempting to fly into california coastal weather below minimums and ""scudrunning"" as its known, is just poor judgment as well as illegal"
"The-Sound_of-Silence","109","Sat Feb 1 08:46:57 2020 UTC","I posted this in another thread discussing this, but I'll repost here: IMC: Instrument Meteorological Conditions, essentially weather conditions requiring you to fly IFR IFR: Instrument Flight Rules, essentially flying via your instruments, only required to see the ground below a certain altitude VFR: Visual Flight Rules, essentially flying while required to see the ground. Not through clouds/fog/etc I'll tell you a story. When I was learning to fly(some time ago), it was in a simple Cessna, with no real IFR instruments, not even a GPS. I was in the interior of B.C., in the mountains. I had planned out a VFR cross-country(airport to airport) flight, and was on my way with my instructor. 1/3 of the way there, a big fluffy cloud crossed our path. The extent of the cloud looked to be difficult to go around, so I said to my instructor that I would turn back, as our origin airport was my alternate. Instructor said 'nah, I have control', and dutifully I said 'you have control'. He said it was likely a small cloud bank, and plowed ahead. He was 100% counting on it being small, as our aircraft lacked the instrumentation to do IFR flying, but after 30 seconds we were still in cloud. At that point, he must have been feeling nervous, and pushed the control stick forward, and we went into a dive. We even exceeded recommended descent rate for the aircraft. Keep in mind, we were traveling a route in between mountains, many of the tops were higher than the path. Luckily, we did come out of the cloud, and we continued our trip at 2000 less feet than planned. Couple of things: He had an IFR rating, but it wouldn't have meant anything there. If we turned back, the company would likely lose money, as I would have to do the flight again(flat rate per student). The other instructors might have made fun of him. I could easily see someone like him, who was somewhat rewarded early on for risky behavior, getting into a dangerous situation later in life"

"primalbluewolf","11","Sat Feb 1 12:41:03 2020 UTC","Huh. In Australia, you can fly under the VFR without being able to see the ground. Flying over clouds, fog or featureless terrain is fine, so long as you can fix your position at least once every 30 minutes - if you have a GPS, that provides such a fix constantly. You just cant be within a fixed distance of a cloud, and in-flight visibility must be above a set value (typically 5km). That story is pretty scary! Wouldnt be using that instructor again after that - possibly not that school. Those rules are in place for a reason, those regulations were written in blood."

Your instructor was an asshole. I can say that because I had some asshole instructors too when I was doing my pilot training. You should have said: ""No we're turning around, I'm the pilot in command, we're not flying into IMC, period."" And then never fly with that guy again."

"MrKeserian","3","Sat Feb 1 15:17:26 2020 UTC","""Simple Cessna"" so probably a 172 or derivative. The 172 is a fantastic aircraft to learn on, because it's stable, has a stall speed of ""stiff headwind"" (seriously, I've seen videos of them levitating at airports in wind if they aren't tied down), and will essentially recover itself from a stall. However, they aren't exactly ""high performance"" aircraft. More than likely, the instructor didn't think he had the altitude to get above the cloud, and by the time he was already in it, was worried that he would get disoriented trying to turn around. Still a dumb decision to go into the cloud in the first place."
"Epimenthus","1","Sat Feb 1 15:47:33 2020 UTC","Ahh Thanks, I never knew they struggled so much with altitude. Very spooky decision in the end."

But accordingly entered uncontrolled airspace and was flying VFR at that point. Because otherwise you have to fly IFR in bad weather. They were in contact with local air traffic controllers and the only mention of height was just to say ""Hey you're to low for the purpose of maintaining radio contact"", not that they weren't permitted. They were reporting their height as is required so it wasn't a mystery."

Actually, having the licensing for bad-weather ops will reduce your premiums, as it's assumed that higher training is needed to procure said certifications. It's the reason many pilots will get IFR-rated even if they don't plan on flying IFR on a routine basis"
"DoomGoober","59","Sat Feb 1 05:14:53 2020 UTC","'Bad weather'? LAPD helicopters were grounded because of the weather conditions. The pilot was also warned by the tower that weather was bad. Tower and LAPD say it's bad weather... it's bad weather. Edit: To be fair: LAPD mainly uses helicopters for scouting/visuals. If visibility is poor, flying a helicopter for visuals is a pretty useless risk. If the Air Amublance/Medi-Vac service grounds their helicopters that's something different."
"kurchak31","23","Sat Feb 1 08:20:18 2020 UTC","Also important to note though that the lapd choppers have very different requirements for not flying than private companies. It depends first on where the lapd was flying from (it was perfectly fine weather where Kobe’s plane initially departed from). Also they run different missions. Lapd is used for surveillance why would they fly to look at fog? So yeah lapd calls things off way sooner than other entities would. I keep seeing that comparison in the news and it’s misleading and truly an apple to oranges deal."
"Biggordie","3","Sat Feb 1 10:12:37 2020 UTC","It’s also important to not that if LAPD is grounded, it can be determined “bad weather” did indeed exist even if they have different criteria and requirements. As such, pilot needed the carts to fly which insurance won’t cover if he did not."
"Kaiisim","3","Sat Feb 1 12:02:47 2020 UTC","It's not misleading? If the fog is so bad the cops cant see, no one can see. That their mission makes it pointless to take off in fog is proof of it being so foggy you couldnt see the ground. Pilot could see as much as the LAPD- nothing at all."
"kurchak31","2","Sat Feb 1 17:06:54 2020 UTC","It is misleading. On top of what I mentioned the helicopters are very different. Kobe’s was top of the line and much more capable. Lapd will call off missions much earlier than a copter like Kobe’s would. I’m not saying the pilot should have flown:m, quite the opposite actually. All I’m saying is the phrase “EVEN the lapd wasn’t flying” as if the lapd is some sort of top tier copter squad. It’s just a misleading statement and means nothing in this case. It should not be used for comparison. Plenty of aviation videos confirm this and head over to r/helicopters and read about it if you’d like"

Also of note the pilot was flying VFR meaning he should have never entered a cloud / fog even with special VFR clearance to take off. Special VFR allows a pilot to take off in less than VFR minimums with the idea being there is VFR weather just outside the airport's airspace and they will get there shortly. Even with SVFR clearance you must remain clear of clouds. The pilot had no IFR flight plan and now this additional information is just adding to the poor decision making. A similar situation happened a few months ago in Manhattan when a helicopter pilot with many hours but no IFR rating dropped off his passenger, then took off, ended up in a cloud, got disoriented, crash landed on a office building roof and died in the crash landing. @thingswendysees caught some of the final seconds."

Even if he was current he was still flying illegally as he was not on a flight plan and the company was not allowed to fly charter IFR flights. Also, while the helicopter they were flying is magnificent - a Sikorksy S 76, this one was 29 years old and purchased for about $500k (new price is ~ $13mm). This particular helicopter did not have a terrain awareness system that would have alerted the pilot of close proximity to the ground, and given its age and purchase price may have not had all the instruments necessary for IFR flight functioning and tested. I think you are likely correct that the pilot made the ""fuck it"" call, and maybe had done that successfully and made it."

But to be honest, I think, in my best guess, something mechanical happened. I don't know the pilot, and am not defending him..

I’m curious on what will happen and what direction Vanessa Bryant would go if she were to file a suit. Maybe it will be to ensure aircraft follow certain protocols. The issue, i think, is simple. Kobe Bryant, I’m guessing, is not an expert on helicopter navigation (even though he frequently was a passenger). He and the others onboard didn’t really have the responsibility of knowing that it was unsafe. So we can check that. As an aircraft passenger, if they say it’s too foggy or snowy to fly, I’d trust them. I don’t know how planes work, i have no idea what a crash will feel like. I’m guessing the pilot was simply cocky, like in the same way someone might not wear a seatbelt, but with the repercussions multiplied by a thousand. And I’m guessing the helicopter company wasn’t as regulated... either way, one thing for sure, the pilot should not have flown in this weather. I think when people deal with celebrities, there’s this subconscious mindset that they are immune to the dangers laymen face. I don’t think celebrities necessarily have this mindset, but maybe people whom they contract. It’s like if you had a private plane- part of the allure is that you are not subject to the same regulations as someone in a commercial vehicle. I also suspect that the aerodynamics and training for a helicopter, or just smaller vehicles in general, is more prone to fucking up.

When they get dispatched to a call they are not allowed to know the nature of the call. They are only allowed to know they're being requested and where. They look at the weather and determine if it's viable for them to fly. Why? Because if they knew the call was for a kid they're going to feel obligated to go no matter what, even if it's unsafe. And that's what kills people. This was a stupid accident that was so easily preventable. I watched a breakdown and listened to the atc recordings. This pilot knew the weather wasn't ideal and made a special request to fly in an area with only a mile visibility. He typically was only cleared to fly in an area with at least 3 miles visibility (Im no expert this is just what I've gathered looking into it). They were flying low to begin with and the margin for error was small. The guy ended up in the fog and that was it, whatever the ultimate cause of his rapid descent I don't think we know for sure yet. But I believe he simply got overwhelmed and didnt realize how close to the ground he was. Again. I'm no expert. No pilot training. I could be and probably am completely wrong.

The go/no go decision was on the pilot and he had many chances to end the flight safely but didn't. They ended up in a cloud and the pilot was unable to maintain positive control of the aircraft without visual ground references. The Sikorsky they were flying did NOT have any kind of auto-hover or low speed autopilot capability so a low speed mode like the one they were in when things went wrong required the pilot to maintain level flight manually with the stick, but you can not do that in a helicopter without ground references unless you are very good and have been practicing it ALOT. As a simple exercise on how this can happen, stand up right now and balance on one leg, go ahead, hold your arms out and just balance there on one leg for 15 seconds. Not too hard, right? Great, now do it with your eyes closed... Not so easy now is it? Well that is exactly what happened to Kobe's pilot. Flying a helicopter is like balancing on one leg. Some people out there can probably balance on one leg with their eyes closed of course, but most of you can't and neither could Kobe's pilot that morning. He wasn't ready for a total whiteout in the cockpit, wasn't practiced in ""instruments only"" hover flight and should not have allowed that situation to occur. The chain of events that lead to this horrible tragedy started when the pilot blew past Van Nuys airport and tried to scud run through the hills of Malibu on a foggy, overcast day. Disclaimer: I am a private pilot with 15 years of flying experience in the LA Basin. I have had to terminate flights for weather on many occasions and each time I have to really dig deep and determine if the flight is safe or not. It's easy to say ""Naahh lets go for it."" Sometimes I have to disappoint my passengers but they always thank me later for making a decision for them based on safety, there is always tomorrow. In aviation, bad decisions can often never be undone, so you have to take each flight seriously and evaluate it on its own merits. And always tell yourself: ""It could happen to me"".

"mintery","2","Sat Feb 1 20:08:47 2020 UTC","I'm just curious, are you a fixed wing pilot or rotary? Because controlling a helicopter in level flight ""manually with the stick"" is not that difficult. Given an artificial horizon and a VSI its a pretty simple task. I don't know the configuration of this helicopter but I can almost guarantee that it at least had those two. From what I've read previously, the pilot was IFR rated so the training to transition to instruments should have been there. Additionally, what info is there that he was at low speed when he potentially went inadvertent? The ads-b data I saw for the last minute of flight had the aircraft well over 100 knots and then accelerating to almost 160 in a dive."

It's easy to assume a lot but this cleared up a lot for me. It still appears to be pilot error and not being able to control the aircraft when getting into an emergency IFR situation and venturing too far into bad conditions in the first place. We aren't going to know the full extent of things until the investigation is complete and I don't think articles like this are particularly helpful for people (like myself) who don't know the extent of the do's and don'ts of helicopter flight and lean on the things that are really only going to be surprising for people who may not be knowledgeable of helicopter aviation."
"Gr33d3ater","27","Sat Feb 1 14:47:11 2020 UTC","The pilot was rated and cleared for IFR. He knew what he was doing. The COMPANY was not cleared to his own IFR level of qualification. Due to the way certifying a company is. So because he was working for them, (while working for them) he wasn’t allowed to fly IFR. If he had been hired privately he was fully cleared for IFR. Not because he wasn’t able to, but because it’s agains the rules. Don’t let the media spin this as he didn’t know what he was doing. He personally did."
"gnudarve","3","Sat Feb 1 17:47:51 2020 UTC","If he knew what he was doing, they would all still be alive. The pilot clearly could not maintain control of the aircraft while in IMC as evidenced by the fact he lost control and crashed."

I remember when it happened, I was in my apartment in Downtown LA and I couldnt see past the next block because it was so foggy.

"potrg801","2","Sat Feb 1 15:52:36 2020 UTC","As it was stated in the video he was IFR certified but so are a lot of pilots because it's required for commercial flight. The issue is that once you have the rating you don't have to do anything to maintain it. So pilots that are certified IFR may have only flown IFR once when they were actually getting certified and never maintained their skills, therefore when this pilot got himself in a situation he shouldn't have he couldn't control the aircraft and he crashed. Also he was going to slow to even be flying IFR in the first place so it wouldn't have done him much good anyways."
"Gr33d3ater","4","Sat Feb 1 16:02:58 2020 UTC","Sounds like a failure of IFR rating and those systems in place already, and not the pilot. Perhaps this should start a discussion about that particular qualification."

"Gr33d3ater","3","Sat Feb 1 16:00:57 2020 UTC","I mean, he was cleared for IFR. That’s a fact. We don’t know what happened, all we know is a crash occurred.

"alicksB","54","Sat Feb 1 11:03:40 2020 UTC","Here's some amplifying info on what u/Calguy1 said. Any of the pilots around here can feel free to chime in or correct me if I say anything wildly off-base. Think of flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) like driving your car. You can kind of go wherever you want, so long as you're following the rules of the road and you're looking outside to make sure you don't hit anything - but there's no one monitoring you and telling you what to do. Flying VFR is the same. You need to follow the published regulations for flight, but Air Traffic Control (ATC) isn't necessarily actively monitoring/controlling you, and you don't need to talk to them either. You're on your own program, and you're basically flying ""see-and-avoid"". It's your responsibility to make sure you don't smack into anything. Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight requires you to be talking to ATC, and in that case, ATC is actively monitoring your flight path. Under IFR, ATC will assume responsibility for collision avoidance (keeping you from smacking into things), but your part in this is complying with the instructions they give you. Now, if ATC gives you instructions that make it seem like you're gonna smack into something it's probably in your best interest to not do that, but ATC should be on top of things enough for that to be a non-issue. Operating under IFR requires both the pilot and the aircraft to be certified - you need to know ATC's procedures and communications, and you need to be able to fly your airplane without looking outside. If you're flying IFR and you fly into some clouds, you have no outside reference to which direction is up/down/whatever, and it can be extremely disorienting, so you need to have practiced how to properly interpret the information your instruments are giving you and fly based off of that. Imagine it this way - driving your car looking only at your dashboard, Google Maps, and a compass and having your passenger tell you exactly what to do. ""Maintain 65 miles per hour and turn left ten degrees, then in 0.6 miles make a 90 degree right turn onto Elm Street."" You need to, without looking outside, make sure you maintain exactly 65 mph, turn ten degrees left, and then make a 90 degree right turn in 0.6 miles. Now imagine adding a third dimension (altitude) to that, and you can see why operating under IFR requires some level of practice and certification for the driver/pilot, and why your car/airplane needs to meet the wickets as well. If your speedometer is off or your compass is a little wonky, you might not be able to properly perform all those instructions ATC gave you - while giving plenty of other instructions to other people - and it can turn into a world of hurt. Realize that the Rules are semi-independent of the conditions. You've got Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC, or ""good weather"") and Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC, or ""bad weather""). If you're flying IFR, you can fly in both VMC and IMC. In either case, ATC will still be giving you instructions to keep you from smacking into things. But if you're flying VFR, you are required to maintain VMC. There are rules on how close you can fly to clouds when you're flying VFR in order to give you the best chances at maintaining VMC. This is all because, as I'd said before, flying VFR means you need to be able to see things to make sure you don't hit those things. And that's where you can get into some real trouble. If you're flying VFR, nobody is looking out for your safety but you. If you fly into a cloud (whether you've gooned up the minimum safe distances, or the weather just rolls in really quickly), you're no longer able to see the stuff you're trying not to hit. Maybe you haven't been trained in flying off your instruments, so you're not used to scanning them all the time. ATC isn't watching out for you, so they're not telling you, ""Climb 500 feet and turn right to heading XYZ,"" to keep you safe. To keep the car analogy going, it's like suddenly driving into a really dense fog. Maybe you're in the correct lane (following the rules), maybe not. You can't tell. Maybe there's someone 30 feet ahead of you who came to a complete stop, maybe not. You don't know 'cause you can't see that far. And because you don't have the omniscient passenger monitoring everything and telling you what to do to keep you safe, you're on your own. Only with flying, unlike in a car, you can't just slow down and pull over to the side of the road. Edit: Thanks for the gold, whoever it was!"

How do planes not run into each other? There’s just so much space in the sky it’s unlikely, and you’ll likely see them before you ever get close to hitting them? What about landing? I assume you have to contact air traffic control a ways out and they organize the flights coming in and diverting non-landing flights around the airport? Edit: These are all fanatic responses. Thanks guys!"
"skarby","4","Sat Feb 1 14:37:30 2020 UTC","How do planes not run into each other? There’s just so much space in the sky it’s unlikely, and you’ll likely see them before you ever get close to hitting them? Yes and no. Most planes have flight radar and transmit their location and have a visible map of all other planes locations and elevations in the area. Basically what your car gps does but you can see all the other vehicles. This isn’t always the case though, older and smaller vehicles sometimes don’t use this and rely on calls on frequency and what you said about likeliness and visual alertness. What about landing? I assume you have to contact air traffic control a ways out and they organize the flights coming in and diverting non-landing flights around the airport? It depends a lot on the airport. There are some with no towers, some with towers that do very little rerouting/direction and some that control every move. Mostly depends on size. If it’s an uncontrolled airport everyone is on the same frequency and calls they are landing on x runway from x heading and they are x distance away, and other pilots will tell them if there is an issue with that. At smaller controlled airports the tower will confirm these calls and say you are cleared to land or reroute you if there is a reason you can’t land there. Larger airports you call and request to land and they will tell you what runway and what heading to land. These are all VFR situations. It’s still your job not to hit anything in the air (mountains and tall buildings) they won’t help with this at all unless you move into IFR."
"alicksB","4","Sat Feb 1 15:01:47 2020 UTC","A combination of things. My initial answer was a super-simplified version, but I'll throw out a bit more of the nuance here for you. First means of deconfliction is altitude. As a general rule, when IFR, eastbound traffic will be on an odd altitude (5000, 7000, 9000, and so on) and westbound traffic will be on even altitudes. For VFR traffic, they apply the same rule, but offset by 500' (so eastbound would be on 5500, 7500, 9500, etc.). Keeping that altitude split helps reduce the number of airplanes in the same piece of sky and creates a certain level of predictability that you can plan both your route and your visual lookout around. ATC plays a big role in this as well. Most aircraft have a transponder with a 4-digit squawk code, which ATC uses to see your location in real-time. Most transponders also have Mode C capability, which broadcasts your altitude in addition to your position. ATC will assign a unique 4-digit squawk code to IFR traffic, and VFR traffic will squawk 1200 by default. This way, ATC can at least see the VFR traffic (that they may not be talking to) and route IFR traffic away from it and maintain deconfliction either via altitude or laterally. In the absence of that, ATC's also got radars that should be able to see any traffic that isn't squawking (for whatever reason). A lot of aircraft (usually not your general aviation types like Cessnas, but maybe some upgraded basic aircraft and all of your airliners) will also have a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that will also ""track"" squawks and Mode C and provide an alert to the pilot of any traffic within X distance. Some of the more advanced TCAS can even interpret trend over time and will provide direction if its algorithm senses an impending collision. To answer your question on landing, I'll give you the annoying answer first - it depends. Different airports are given different designations (Class B, C, D, or E) for their airspace depending on how busy they are, and the size of the boundary around the airfield itself also differs based on which Class it is. Without getting to deep into the specifics, to fly into Class B, C, or D (your busier airports) you need to have two-way radio communications with ATC before you enter the boundaries of the airspace so that ATC can keep an eye on you and direct you around as needed. Flying into B/C/D airspace without following the proper procedures will likely get you flight violated (see: following the ""rules of the road"") and could come with legal ramifications once the FAA figures out who you are. Airfields which are in Class E airspace (which encompasses more than just airports, but that's another story) have none of those requirements, and are typically your smaller airfields without a control tower. In this case, you just have to be familiar with the published procedures for that airfield (what altitude the landing pattern is flown at, which direction the landing pattern flow is, and so on) and fly in accordance with those while keeping a lookout for anyone else. If you have a radio, there's often a published Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) for these small airfields that you should be listening in on in order to build your situational awareness. Even though CTAF isn't controlled or monitored by ATC, you should still make radio calls on CTAF to let anyone else flying in the area know where you are and what you're doing, and you should be listening up for the same info from the other folks."
"ddthj","2","Sat Feb 1 14:43:44 2020 UTC","Yeah you'll see other planes before you get close. Think about how far down a highway you can still see other cars. The 3D space makes things a little trickier, but pilot's usually have their own scanning technique for looking for traffic. You're right to think some communication is required for takeoff and landing, but only at controlled airports. If a pilot is flying VFR there's usually a good chance they'll also call up a radar facility and ask for radar service (flight following). This allows a VFR pilot to get traffic advisories from ATC, which also let's ATC know who the VFR pilot is and what they're doing. There are also uncontrolled airports that don't require radio (but still recommend so you can self-announce your intentions)."

"bearorr1992","8","Sat Feb 1 08:35:50 2020 UTC","It probably felt very normal inside, because flight is dynamic and the forces will lie to you. That is why IMC requires instruments, you cannot fly by the seat of your pants when you lose the horizon. As an extreme example, a properly executed barrell roll is a +1g manuever, even the upside down part. Which is why Tex Johnson was famously able to perform one in the 707 prototype. If the pilots got disoriented in the clouds and continued trying to fly with their eyes and their butts like they had been 10 seconds prior, it could have been a very smooth flight until the last moment when the mountain appeared through the mist."

The carburettor and piot tube are two completely different systems. Turbines don't have a carburettor. Otto cycle can have both, it's just a idealised thermodynamic cycle for either a fuel driven 2 or 4 stroke engine, it depends on the engine system not the thermodynamic cycle which only vaugely describes the pressure/volume of an engine though it's stages."

"AmALolyer","12","Sat Feb 1 18:52:06 2020 UTC","Not that I know of, we don't use catalytic converters or anything like that, av gas is low led so it's not needed but if it was used would add weight and reduce engine performance. just between you and me, aviation has a special place above regulation and normal laws. Engines are a fine line between weight and performance, aircraft engines have gotten more efficient over time, I think they've nearly doubled commerical fuel efficiency since the 50s. it's not my area of expertise but most inovation in commerical aviation is driven by better efficiency so while there is no legislative requirements most companies strive towards it as an economic benefit. There's a lot of old engines around in Aviation, everything's a compromise, diesel would be far more efficient then AV gas or jet fuel but high fuel grades are used because they have the lowest relative density, (weigh the least) when you need to carry 31,000 gallons and one fuel weighs 6.01 pounds per gallon and the other 6.8 pounds per gallon, that weight difference is the whole cargo capacity of a commerical aircraft, there's no much room for extra weight. look as far as I know theres no real environmental requirements, and any that there are would be hard to enforce because aircraft fly internationally so much. We still run 3350s and after starting those a few dozen times I can tell you they are very dirty engines but during WW2 nothing else matched its power and performance."

Also the company that operated the helicopter did not have a license for IFR operation."

"Smearwashere","182","Sat Feb 1 00:23:22 2020 UTC","Well it depends. If the company told the pilot not to fly in fog then it's the pilot's fault. In fact the pilot has a responsibility to know the capabilities of his aircraft and to fly within those, so it's still the pilot's fault unless, somehow, the company has hidden defects from him. Of course, since the pilot was working for the company, anything that was the pilot's fault is also the company's fault for hiring an incompetent pilot. It will be interesting to see the extent to which this is true legally."

"pittguy578","13","Sat Feb 1 12:58:15 2020 UTC","I think it could result in a change of regulations, VFR easily works when judging if they should takeoff. Once they are on the air it's up to the pilot to use planning along with the maneuverability of the helicopter to avoid IFR conditions. Which in reality isn't always going to happen, so you are creating events where pilot's will end up in IFR conditions without an instrument rating. The reliance on the skills and judgement of the pilot appears to have failed in this instance. Thus I would assume there may be a push for helicopters with more than x passengers must have an instrument rating."

"stoolsample2","12","Sat Feb 1 01:55:09 2020 UTC","Police helicopters and pilots aren’t instrument rated at all in Southern California. Remember the point of police helicopters is to supply visual support for the ground, if visibility is compromised then there’s zero point to operate, so police don’t bother with instrument flights regardless if they’re possible. Especially so in Southern California when most days weather is clear. That police helicopters were grounded doesn’t really say it was unsafe to fly. An instrumented flight could have flown fine in fog. It seems like the pilot poorly judged conditions and tried to go visual when he should have flown under instrument rules."

Even some nazi jokes hit, I ain't gonna lie. Again: context, context, context. Comedy is all about context. I'm a Norwegian and I even remember that day when the towers fell. My mother took time off from work, and us from school, so that we could sit and watch the horrible updates on TV as they came rolling in. Norway being a country where my ancestors had to eat grass and fight lugers with their bare hands to oppose the nazi regime. Take from that what you will."

"bobbyleendo","109","Tue Feb 18 16:30:56 2020 UTC","Depends upon what you mean. If you're just talking shit about someone who's dead, putting words in their mouth: that isn't okay. But if you remember that one time he wore a shirt the wrong way and insisted that it was a point of style, something everyone remembers, something that humanises the dead, then that's okay. Putting words in the mouth of the dead pisses me off even more. Laughing about something, having a good time and remembering those who have passed away is a form of grieving. Not a lot of people get that. Some would like to put the dead on a pedistool, exclusively with a somber disposition, which is in itself disingenuous and dishonest. You're not really trying to do the person justice, but actually just robbing people of a healthy grieving process. Additionally I can laugh about jokes regarding cancer, even if my mother died of luchemia. This is not a slight against the dead, but a service for those who suffer from cancer now. It's always the elephant in the room, that serves to do nothing more than making the person suffering from cancer feel more awkward. Humour about it can help the person come to terms with their condition, and even their own mortality. You don't want a room full of people feeling bad for you once you enter it. That makes it suck even more. Even if your fate is sealed the last days of your life shouldn't be spent in misory. You know that it's coming. Enjoy yourself in the last moments you have on this earth. Please take that with you. I can't stress enough how important these principles are. Western grieving rituals are messed up. We need to change it."

Ya know, me and dad say and talked about the death of Kobe for a bit and we both agreed that it felt like we lost a family member of some sort, he didn't say that exactly but I did and the way he explained how he felt basically made me think we agreed. But, we sat there a little longer and realized how we never knew this man, not really and how ridiculous it was to feel this way. But fuck dude, I grew up on Kobe, I watched almost all of his games as a kid all the through until he finished his final season with the Lakers. The man has touched so many people in many different way even without being there with us. I sat here and watched the All Star game and Kobe's presence was sorely missed."

But its just going to live on as one of those fake true things now no matter what, even if you go back and watch the games. That's a funny and weird thing about getting old. You watch some shit, you live through it, and you watch OTHER people 20 years later tell you what you saw with your own eyes is the other way around, and they can prove it because some white people wrote this and that about it at the time. And don't worry....it will happen to you, too."

Kobe was a POS 1: Not a ppd 1: It's targeted harassment at someone else 1: doesn't fit the sub 1: Not a pussy pass denied /u/Dylkim: There's a myth that Kobe's defense team leaked the name of Kobe's accuser. This is not true. Kobe's lawyers were allowed, by the judge, to bring up Faber's name. The Court and the Eagle County Justice Center's staff accidentally leaked the name. http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/judge-dont-call-kobe-bryant-accuser-victim Prosecutor dismissed a witness, without telling the defense, simply because he contradicted their evidence. The sexual assault expert claimed jaw injury and vagina trauma are very much possible in consensual sex. Why is this so important? Prosecutor's entire case was predicated on the neck injury and vaginal trauma. Weirdly enough, this is never mentioned among news sites attacking Bryant. http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/09/03/authorities-defend-handling-kobe-case.html The accuser had sex hours after her encounter with Kobe Bryant. However, before you guys try to use the ""Sexual assault victims can be very unpredictable"" card, (Which is somewhat valid) before this evidence was revealed, the accuser and the prosecutor's stances differed strongly from this. To exemplify, prosecutor tries to fight this evidence by saying she had sex BEFORE the encounter, but the forensic expert was very doubtful. If she had sex before the Kobe incident, there would be some DNA found on Kobe's clothing; Nothing was found http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/us/papers-reveal-new-details-in-kobe-bryant-rape-case.html https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/ Before the actual trial took place, including the civil court, the accuser bragged about the money she was going to get from Kobe. . You know what's worse? 3 days before Kobe was charged, she was seen by more than 5 people bragging about her encounter with Kobe. http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-bragged-partygoer-happy-article-1.512242 http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/11/06/docs-kobe-accuser-discussed-award-money.html Her ex-friend reveals the accuser had celebrity addiction for a long time. She tried to do the same thing to Eminem. She also wanted to testify: http://www.contactmusic.com/kobe-bryant/news/ex.pal-reveals-kobe.s-accuser-plotted-to-lure-eminem-into-bed She was seen leaving the hotel without any noticeable discomfort: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kobe-records-released/ She had a history of mental illness that was dangerous to herself and her peer: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.showbiz.gossip/n2cprdAFQJE (This evidence would not be accepted in today's court but was registered in 2004) The prosecutor lacked evidence. Not only evidence, they were badly losing against Kobe's defense team: ""This ruling will make it much, much tougher for prosecutors to convict Bryant of sexual assualt,'' says legal analyst Cohen. ""The physical evidence against him never was that strong to begin with and now this evidence is likely to tilt the 'he said, she said' battle squarely in Bryant's favor."" https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/ The accuser lied and changed her story multiple times. I am okay with giving accusers the benefit of the doubt, but this was alarming. Because there was a witness who saw her without any visible discomfort (This is my assumption), she claimed she was forced to wash her face and settle down before leaving Kobe's room. What's even worse? she was given a chance to correct herself months after the initial statement; she continued the lie. She didn't admit to her mistake for a whole year. http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-mixups-admits-lies-claim-article-1.548757 Finally, the settlement. People actually use this as Kobe's confession. Kobe was strongly advised by his own defense team AND other prosecution to settle this case. Why? He could risk losing everything, and it does not help that he's a black man. If he didn't settle, it would take years for this case to conclude; his wife also had a miscarriage during this time. When you settle a case, it's a compromise with you and the defendant; you don't think the accuser wanted Kobe to say those things? To substantiate this, the accuser asked for ""unspecified amount of money, as well as public vindication."". She got both in the settlement. The accuser is the one who wanted this comment. Its what the lawyers, from both sides, agreed to make Kobe sign to end it; it has nothing to do with Kobe's actual feelings or the reality of the case. This is a settlement. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-09-28/news/0409290017_1_accuser-lin-wood-kobe-bryant By all accounts, this was a false accusation. I will never say I am 100% certain, but I am sure enough that he did not rape this woman. It's really funny how the media changed narratives to fit their agendas. I have never seen them bring up how much the prosecution was insanely unethical to Kobe AND many of his witnesses. The prosecutor, Lin Wood, is also a horrific person. POST IS STAYING"

"MrMallow","387","Fri Jan 31 04:11:23 2020 UTC","Honestly I get that it was over a decade ago, but I live in the community in Colorado where Kobe raped that girl. I was here when it happened and I remember him saying ""I understand how she could have 'mistakenly' seen it as rape"". I remember him denying ever knowing her until they got him with DNA evidence and he changed his story. Him implying that since he didn't see it as rape that it didn't count and she was so terrified by the event and media frenzy that she didn't want to testify so he got off. Just because he went on to have an amazing career doesn't mean it never happened. Our community certainly never forgot. EDIT: the amount of apologists messaging me is astounding. He raped a 19 year old girl just out of high school working in the hotel he was staying at, she was to scared to testify (as is common in rape cases) so it never went to trial. I literally live in the community it happened in (then and now)."

Bryant's lawyers told ESPN that the apology was a condition of the woman, who ""insisted on that statement as a price of freedom."" The criminal case could not practically go on without her testimony. One reporter's opinion was that the two parties had struck a deal outside the prosecutor's office. In any case I believe it based on legal advice when it was clear that he would be going for a civil settlement. ie. Not a heartfelt statement of belief but a legal tactic. Once you get rid of the criminal case you have to settle the civil one. A expression of sympathy that avoids legal culpability is known to help in mediation there.Ref (Though it took over a year to actually get settled) ""....I issue this statement today fully aware that while one part of this case ends today, another remains....""

You're allowed to have your own opinions on what you think he did, but that's just what they are. They're not facts, they're just you asserting that he did it because you say so and then calling the people who disagree with you rape apologists. This is not rape apologia or deifying celebrities. This is completely justified skepticism from people who have already seen false accusation after false accusation falling against other guys, especially famous or wealthy guys that play professional sports (Brian banks, anyone?). An especially disgusting tactic is to drop the accusation after they've expired, so you can cash in on the media attention of your bullshit survivor story when the accused can't even defend themselves. ""Cancel culture"" uses this tactic a lot. Without a trial, he can't be considered a rapist in the eyes of the law. I give absolutely zero shits about her being ""scared"" to testify, that's what happens when we run this bullshit ""don't tell rape victims to report"" campaign centered around protecting people's sensibilities at the expense getting justice and punishing rapists. If it truly happened to her, she should have reported it. I say this as the victim of two sexual assaults and an attempted rape. Report it. The potential to get victim blamed or re-traumatized is a small sacrifice compared to what might happen if you let your rapist walk free.

In particular, strong employment agreements are essential to the success of journalists' ability to do what they are ostensibly employed to do - reveal facts and truths that are sometimes a challenge to the social status quo but necessary for a healthy society to know. What we see with weak employment contracts, especially for journalism, is the arbitrary and capricious way in which corporate insecurity outweighs what should be a proud burden, to report on noteworthy topics and inform society. Instead, because we deify capitalism, our relationship with information sharing and especially journalism all but precludes any real journalism from occurring, because the priority is to be correct politically and not critical. There, now that I'm done with that soapbox I'll get on another to add this: An employer has a right to expect some level of compliance and decorum from their employees. Certainly, when it is relevant to the company's interests, an employee representing them in public should be expected to do so without risking the respectability or reputation of the company. But where we start to lose our collective shit as a society is at the point where a company can then influence all your speech and punish you for having opinions. I work for one such large company, and my criticism of them is grounds for my termination. Any criticism. Anywhere. Any time. I'm supposed to get their permission to type this. That shit is fucked up, and you will find no ally in me for support of corporate rights in that regard. Was she speaking as an employee? As a journalist? As a private citizen? I have no idea. But maybe we should start considering whether it's the right thing to do to just airlock someone the minute they park it on a hill you don't like. We're all people, we all say shit that pisses someone else off eventually, and to say that somehow that's not okay and that we can all just be disposable corporate mouthpieces or nothing at all is just reprehensible."

I agree that you can't look at your hero (or anyone for that matter) with black marker censoring the worst parts of their history. You have to remember them in totality, warts and all. However, posting the article so swiftly after his passing felt like a weird grab to get clicks/bring attention to while the tragedy was still fresh in people's hearts. Maybe that's the best time to confront people with unfortunate truths but either way, the reaction was no less surprising because of when she put it out."
"anotherteapot","2","Fri Jan 31 16:04:18 2020 UTC","That is definitely true.

Celebrate them in life, not just giving meaningless platitudes once they are dead. It's like talking about how important someone was, then finding out they fell on hard times later in life and died penniless and alone. If they mattered so much, why didn't you check up on them before hearing they were dead and agreeing to an interview?"

That would be called a record. Can you think of any example in sports where somebody is given an award or trophy for breaking a record? It just doesn’t happen. If LeBron ever breaks the all time record for points scored he’s not going to get The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Points Trophy. Instead, he will just become the record holder. Lastly, besides fact that awards like you are referencing don’t exist, if an award was created to honor Kobe that almost nobody ever received that’s not a great way to keep his name alive. At least with the All-Star MVP Trophy his name will still be relevant year to year and for a while players may play harder in that game to win that award honoring his competitive spirit. Edit: And don’t just be sure there are several milestones. Research it and then come back. What if there aren’t any of these mythical records to name an award after?"

Not to mention this is a case where it is literally 100% hearsay and the character of the alleged victim was questionable. Not to mention they seemed to settle it amicably and she admitted to directly lying about some details. So yeah lets not get all cut and dry on a hearsay case with limited details. Yes its bad for everyone, yes its worse for her than him, no we dont know what happened. Kobe isnt responsible for the public's interest in the case and took his lawyers' advice in the defense.
